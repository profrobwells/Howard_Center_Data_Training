Results of the Year with Vladimir Putin&#160;

December 19, 2024, Moscow

Vladimir Putin summed up the results of the year and answered questions from journalists and the people of
Russia in a live broadcast.

Channel One war correspondent Dmitry Kulko and VGTRK presenter Alexandra Suvorova moderated the Results
of the Year with Vladimir Putin.

***

Deputy Chief of Staff of the Presidential Executive Office - Presidential Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov: Good
afternoon everyone.

The President will be here within minutes to review the results of the outgoing year. I would like to remind you that
this year we combine two events, the news conference and Direct Line.

Please show respect for your colleagues when I give the floor to journalists and make your questions as concise
and clear as possible. This will allow the President to answer more questions.

Our moderators this year are Alexandra Suvorova and Dmitry Kulko, who will talk with the President. They worked
hard to personally read extremely many questions from our people, possibly tens of thousands of them. They

                                                                                                      Page 2 of 62
                            

understand what the people of Russia are talking about and will help the President outline the subjects that are at
the top of the agenda throughout the country.

Please.

Alexandra Suvorova: Good afternoon. This is the Results of the Year with Vladimir Putin. As usual, questions can
be submitted in a number of ways until the end of our programme. Our colleagues continue working with the
incoming questions.

First, you can submit your questions by calling 8 (800) 200 4040 or sending an SMS or MMS message to 04040.
Questions can also be submitted via the programme's official accounts on Vkontakte and Odnoklassniki. You can
also use the website and mobile app called moskva-putinu.ru.

We have already received over 2.2 million questions, including 1.2 million via telephone, about 43,000 via SMS
messages, and over 140,000 via the website. We can see that the number of questions is increasing in real time.

Let me share some interesting facts and figures on the Results of the Year with Vladimir Putin programme since
this format was created. There was a time when the Direct Line and the news conference were two separate
events and formats. This is the third time we are having it in a hybrid format. The first time it happened was before
the COVID pandemic, the second was a post-COVID event in 2023, and now we are in 2024. Once again, the
programme is taking place in a hybrid format, which means that both the people of Russia and, of course,
journalists get to ask questions.

Here are some interesting statistics. For example, the event with the biggest number of questions took place in
2015 when the President received 2.25 million questions. This year, we have not reached this number. However, I
believe that this could be attributable to the fact that regions hold their own direct lines, with governors answering
questions from their people at the regional level. Therefore, some questions get resolved on the ground.

One thing to note here is that if we add up all the time Vladimir Putin has spent answering questions during events
of this kind, the total already exceeds 64 hours. People have been tuning in from the regions since 2001 when the
very first programme of this kind took place. It goes without saying that there will also be people joining us via
videoconference from the regions today. Throughout the years when we had the Direct Line and the Results of the
Year, people have been proactively contributing to these events not only by raising various issues with the
President, sharing their concerns or asking for something, but also by expressing their gratitude. This year,
considering that we are holding this event on December 19, we also received New Year greetings. This is another
trend I wanted to mention.

Of course, social matters are in the spotlight today, judging by the submissions we have selected. Many questions
deal with the special military operation. International matters are also high on the agenda, of course. So let us get
started.

Dmitry Kulko: President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin.

For the third year in a row, volunteers from the Russian Popular Front have been helping prepare our programme
and process the messages and calls. This year, they were also joined by veterans of the special military operation.
For ten days since the free telephone line opened, they, too, have been taking phone calls. However, the Russian
Popular Front's work does not end today. In fact, we can say that it is only just beginning, because the moment the
broadcast ends, the Popular Front volunteers will continue to work on the appeals people made to ensure that none
of them is left unattended.

Alexandra Suvorova: I would like to add that some of the appeals have already been processed during the
preparations for the Results of the Year programme, and some of the issues have been addressed by Popular
Front volunteers and regional and federal authorities.

There is one more aspect that is different this year. GigaChat, an AI model provided by Sber, has helped us
process people's appeals and questions. Mr President, I know that you have already seen it.

                                                                                                        Page 3 of 62
                             

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: I have.

Dmitry Kulko: Yes, GigaChat has drawn conclusions. This technology can do more than transcribe audio files into
text - it can also extract the message and the essence of the problem, which has significantly accelerated the
processing of requests this year. You will be able to see GigaChat's insights on the screen throughout the
programme. You will see the key subjects of people's appeals, across the country and in each region. We will be
using this virtual assistant during the programme today.

Anna Suvorova: Before we start taking questions from our people and our colleagues, journalists, I would like to ask
the first general question.

In recent time, everyone has been feeling a disturbing sense that the world is going crazy, or already has, because
the potential for conflict is off the charts in every part of the world, and the global economy is struggling. How does
Russia manage not only to stay afloat, but also to continue growing in this situation?

Vladimir Putin: You know, when all is calm and life is measured and stable, we get bored. This amounts to
stagnation, so we crave action. When action begins, time starts whistling by - or bullets do, for that matter.
Unfortunately, bullets are what is zipping past our heads these days. We are scared, yes - but not as "all get out"
kind of scared.

Our economics are the ultimate measure of things. As is traditional, I will start with the economy. Although your
question was a bit provocative, I will turn to the economy anyway. The economy is number one; it is the
cornerstone. It has an impact on living standards, general stability, and the country's defence capability. The
economy is everything.

The economic situation in Russia is generally positive and stable. We are growing in spite of everything, in spite of
any external threats or attempts at outside influence.

As you know, last year Russia increased its GDP by 3.6 percent, and this year the economy is expected to grow by
3.9 percent, or possibly even four percent. However, we will have to wait and see the final results, as the year-end
figures will be de facto factored into these projections in the first quarter of next year, which will be 2025 in this
particular case. It may well be that this indicator reaches four percent. What this means is that our economy will
have grown by eight percent over the past two years. After all, the tenths and hundredths of a percent make for a
negligeable difference. This is what experts have been telling me - we exchanged views this very morning. About
eight percent over the past two years, compared to a growth rate between five and six percent for the United
States, one percent for the Eurozone, and zero for Germany, the EU's leading economy. It seems that next year
that country will also have zero growth.

International financial and economic institutions ranked Russia as Europe's biggest economy in terms of volume, in
terms of purchasing power parity, and the world's fourth largest economy. We are behind China, the United States
and India. Last year, Russia surpassed Germany and this year, we left Japan behind. But this is not the time for us
to be complacent. We will definitely keep moving forward.

There is development everywhere you look and so much positive momentum across the board. If the Eurozone has
fallen asleep, there are other centres of global development that are advancing. The situation in the Eurozone and
the United States has been changing too. We must maintain the momentum we have gathered and transform our
economy at its core, from a qualitative perspective.

There are other general performance indicators which have been quite satisfactory, to say the least. Unemployment
is the first such indicator. All countries around the world, and all economies, pay a great deal of attention to this
figure. For Russia, it is at its all-time low of 2.3 percent. We have not experienced anything like this before. This is
my first point.

                                                                                                      Page 4 of 62
                            

Second, there has been growth in specific manufacturing and industrial sectors. In fact, industrial output increased
by 4.4 percent, while the processing sector reported a growth rate of 8.1 percent, with some of its sectors achieving
even higher growth rates.

Of course, inflation has been causing some concerns. Only yesterday, while preparing for today's event, I talked to
the Central Bank Governor, and Elvira Nabiullina told me that the inflation rate has already reached about 9.2-9.3
percent year-to-date. That said, salaries have increased by nine percent, and I am talking about an increase in real
terms, minus inflation. In addition, disposable incomes have also increased. So, the overall situation is stable and,
let me reiterate, solid.

There are certain challenges with inflation and with the economy heating up. Therefore, the Government and the
Central Bank have been seeking to ensure a soft landing. Estimates may vary for next year, but we expect the
economy to grow at a rate of 2-2.5 percent. This soft landing would enable us to keep improving our
macroeconomic performance.

This is what we must aspire to. I think that we will probably raise these matters during today's meeting. Overall, the
economy can be described as stable and resilient.

Alexandra Suvorova: I have a follow-up question, given the numerous questions surrounding price growth, to which
we will return. You have cited Germany and Japan as examples. I wish to focus on Germany having a zero percent
growth rate, which you mentioned as a case previously known for its economic expansion.

Do you believe this is perhaps linked to politics and sovereignty? Not long ago, at the VTB Forum Russia Calling!,
you reminisced about Gerhard Schroeder's birthday celebration, remarking how all the songs were in English, with
none performed in German.

Vladimir Putin: There were. It's an interesting episode. Quite some time ago, it was Gerhard Schroeder's birthday,
he invited me and I attended. There was a small concert, and, as it happened, all the companies performed in
English. I remarked at the time, "Even the Hannover girls' choir sang in English."

There was, however, one ensemble that performed in German: the Kuban Cossack Choir, which accompanied me.
Moreover, this was entirely unexpected on my part. I inquired, "How did you come to know these songs?" They
replied, "Out of respect for the Germans, our hosts, we learnt these songs en route and performed them in German,
including those from the local region where we are now."

During the intermission, numerous attendees approached me (I recount this as it truly unfolded) and expressed,
"We are embarrassed, truly, that only Russian Cossacks performed in German here."

I recounted this to a colleague who was present at the event, which has now been recalled. You see, sovereignty is
a crucial concept; it must reside within, in one's heart. In the post-war era, I believe this sense - of homeland and
sovereignty - has been somewhat eroded among the German people.

Who are the Europeans, after all? They are proud to be European, yet they are foremost French, German, Italian,
Spanish, and then European. There is a tendency to smooth out things, to homogenise. Ultimately, this affects
everything, including the economy.

I previously spoke about our economic growth - this is largely attributable to the reinforcement of sovereignty, which
extends to the economic realm.

Many foreign manufacturers have exited our market. What has been the consequence? Our entrepreneurs have
started producing these goods domestically, necessitating further research and the engagement of institutions,
including those focused on development. All of this - what we are discussing - is the enhancement of technological
sovereignty.

                                                                                                            Page 5 of 62
                              

Sovereignty manifests itself in various forms: defence, technology, science, education, culture. This is of paramount
importance, especially for our nation, because should we lose sovereignty, we risk losing statehood. That is the
crux.

Economic growth is also an effect of bolstered sovereignty.

Dmitry Kulko: Mr President, I suggest we move on to questions from our citizens.

Vladimir Putin: Yes, let us begin.

Dmitry Kulko: You spoke about economic growth. It is true that a look at our economic indicators, which do look
good, shows that the majority of Russian enterprises are working to capacity and wages are rising, yet they cannot
keep pace with price increases.

Many Russian citizens have written about this, and AI has analysed all the requests and compiled a list of regions
where more questions concerned price growth. These are eastern regions, such as the Kamchatka Territory and
the Sakhalin Region, and also our westernmost territory, the Kaliningrad Region. Also, the majority of questions
from the Irkutsk Region concern price growth. In short, it is a topical issue.

Alexandra Suvorova: It is topical indeed. I will cite the figures which have also been provided by GigaChat, which
we are using.

The most frequent questions have to do with the rise in prices of bread, fish, milk, eggs and butter. People also
write about the growth of fuel prices. This file contains some of the citizens' questions about price growth.

If we look at the official data of the Federal State Statistics Service (Rosstat), we got it last night, we will see that the
prices of fruits and vegetables have increased by 3.4 percent over the past week. For example, the price of
cucumbers has grown by ten percent after rising by 43 percent in November.

Vladimir Putin: First, I would like to apologise to the audience, especially those who are following this event via
various media platforms, including online. When I said that price growth or inflation was slightly above nine percent
this year, at 9.2-9.3 percent, and that people's wages and real disposable incomes have grown as well, I cited
average figures. Of course, our country is very big, and some people might ask me what I was talking about, that
their well-being has not improved but remained at the same level. And some might even say that their well-being
has deteriorated. Yes, this can be so and it is so, in some cases. I cited average figures, because when we make
plans, we need to have figures to rely on, and we can only rely on average figures.

As for the growth of prices, there are both objective and subjective reasons for that.

What is more important is that the supply in our market should correlate with people's incomes, or rather, people's
incomes and their purchasing capacity should correlate with the volume of goods produced in the country. Wages
and incomes have been growing faster than the mass of commodities and the rate of production.

I will explain. Let's say, food production in our country is constantly growing. I will talk about this later. There will
certainly be questions on agriculture. In fact, I can tell you that it adds three percent every year. We are fully self-
sufficient when it comes to meat. One hundred percent.

It is a good indicator. Why does this happen? In Russia, the annual consumption of meat is about 80 kg per capita
while in other countries, it is about 42 kg on average. It may seem enough and yet, meat consumption has doubled
recently, you see? Doubled.

Now, milk. Milk production grows every year, but consumption grows as well, and there is not enough milk to
produce butter. I know that the butter prices have grown by 33-34 percent in some regions, and possibly higher in
others.

                                                                                                      Page 6 of 62
                            

Simply, the amount of products has not grown as much as consumption has. This is the first reason. The solution
here would be to develop industries. And I will talk more about it later.

The second objective reason is harvest.

The third objective reason is that some products have become more expensive on world markets.

Of course, the external restrictions, sanctions and so forth are affecting the prices to a certain extent. They do not
play a key role but still, they take a toll as they make logistics more expensive, in addition to other things.

There are also subjective reasons or things we could improve on our side. For example, some experts believe that
the Central Bank could have used certain instruments other than raising the key rate, more efficiently and at an
earlier stage. Yes, the Central Bank started doing it around summer. But again, these experts believe that it could
have and should have been done earlier. There are many instruments. I will not list them now and will not tire our
audience with these considerations about the Central Bank and its regulation methods.

The Government works efficiently and does a lot when it thinks about the future - and the future should always be
considered. In our country, we always thought about the future even during the harshest times of the Great Patriotic
War. We know these examples. There were efforts made and, as it turned out later, correct efforts.

Our Government does think about the future: it formulates tasks, national development goals and national projects.
It is wonderful but it would also be great to take timely efforts with respect to industries and consider the
development of certain sectors, the production of mass products. I will not list them now - perhaps, there will be
questions on specific industries later. Timely decisions should have been made.

Growing prices are not something to enjoy and they have adverse impacts. But I hope that overall, as we preserve
macroeconomic indicators, we shall address this issues as well because macroeconomics is the basis for a healthy
economy in general.

Dmitry Kulko: Mr President, we are holding today's event in a combined format, a direct line and a news
conference. I now suggest that our journalist colleagues ask a question.

Alexandra Suvorova: We can sense that those present in the hall are eager to ask their questions.

Dmitry Peskov: Indeed, the audience is quite eager. Allow me ...

A question from the audience.

Dmitry Peskov: You know, if we behave this way, it would be disrespectful towards everyone else.

Vladimir Putin: Nevertheless, let us refrain from acting this way, and let us begin. What is your name?

Alina Khastsayeva: My name is Alina Khastsayeva, I represent the 15th Region information website in North
Ossetia.

Vladimir Putin: Alina, go ahead, please.

Alina Khastsayeva: The issue of professional service personnel has become increasingly important. Multiple
schools, including the North Caucasus Military Institute of Interior Troops in North Ossetia, used to train military
specialists in the North Caucasus.

Quite literally, a legendary institute: seven of its graduates became Heroes of the Soviet Union, and 14 more
received the title of Heroes of Russia. To this very day, its graduates are successfully carrying out missions set by
our state. Its graduates include former Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov, and Sergei Khairutdinov, a recent graduate,
became Hero of Russia while taking part in the special military operation.

                                                                                                       Page 7 of 62
                              

Is it possible to reinstate this institute at a time when the North Caucasus and the whole of Russia need it so much?
Thank you.

Vladimir Putin: Alina, thank you for this question. This is a good point, and do not be angry with Alina; here is why.

First, North Ossetia has always been Russia's outpost in this region, in the Caucasus, and it has always justified its
lofty designation. We know how the republic's residents feel about their region and about Russia, our large common
Motherland. They have always defended it and have fulfilled this role worthily and admirably.

You have noted that the number of schools has been reduced. This is not linked to a decision to close them in
Ossetia alone. It is related to the fact that, according to military specialists and agencies, there were too many
military schools, and the Russian army did not need so many specialists and so much service personnel at the time.
Due to various circumstances, we are now increasing the strength of the army, security and law enforcement
agencies to 1.5 million people. I cannot say that we will achieve this tomorrow, but I promise you that we will
certainly analyse this issue.

Thank you.

Dmitry Peskov: We continue working with the audience. Let us go back to the centre after all.

ITAR-TASS, please.

Mikhail Petrov: Mikhail Petrov, Editor-in-Chief, TASS.

Mr President, before I ask my question, I would like to thank you.

This year, TASS is celebrating its 120th anniversary. We are this country's oldest news agency. Earlier this year, in
August, you signed an Executive order on awarding TASS the Order for Valiant Labour. On behalf of our large team
and at their instructions, I want to take a message of many thanks to you. This is a high praise for our work.

Vladimir Putin: Thank you.

Mikhail Petrov: As for the question, I think this issue is of concern for all of us today. Incidentally, TASS
correspondents sent reports from the fronts during the Great Patriotic War. Today, too, our men are working in the
special military operation zone, and they are concerned as well.

How do you assess the progress in the special military operation, which has lasted for nearly three years now? Is
the victory nearer?

Vladimir Putin: I certainly hoped for questions of this kind. There are many of these within the bulk [of messages]
that came in during the previous days. Moreover, I am grateful to you, too, for [asking this question], because this
enables us to show what is going on and what our troops are doing at the battle contact line.

You know, the fighting men, with whom I am in regular contact, send souvenirs, chevrons, some weapons, and so
on. Not long ago, men from the 155th Marine Brigade of the Pacific Fleet gave me a copy of their colours.

Who can I ask to assist me? Come over to me, please, and someone from that side. I have a big favour to ask. You
take a position here and you - there, and unfold this banner, please, at both ends.

Dmitry Kulko: Pacific Fleet marines.

Vladimir Putin: Yes.

I have brought it along on purpose.

First, I wanted to thank the men for this gift.

                                                                                                         Page 8 of 62
                             

Second, let us consider than this banner of the 155th Marine Brigade of the Pacific Fleet represents all the combat
banners of our soldiers, who are fighting for Russia, for the Motherland, along the entire line of contact.

I must say that the situation is changing radically. You know this well and I just want to reaffirm this. The drive is on
along the entire frontline every day.

As I said, the advance is not by 100, 200, or 300 metres. Our fighting men are regaining the territory by square
kilometers. I want to stress - every day! Why is this happening?

First, last year, and this basically is the classical course of hostilities, the enemy attacks, sustains a heavy defeat,
loses a lot of equipment, ammunition and personnel, and then the other side starts to push forward. In our case, this
is happening exactly in this way. Combat operations are a difficult thing. So, it is hard - and makes no sense - to
think far too ahead. But it happens precisely in this way. And we are advancing, as we said, towards achieving the
priority goals that we outlined at the start of the special military operation.

As for our troops, they are acting heroically. I say this regularly and will repeat it, because there is every reason for
saying so. Right now, the 155th Brigade is fighting in the Kursk Region and pushing the enemy out from our land.
Of course, they are not alone. Fighting alongside them are the 810th Marine Brigade of the Black Sea Fleet, the
76th and 106th divisions of the Airborne Troops, and motorised infantry of the Sever Group. All of them are fighting
heroically in the direct sense of the word. And they are involved in an engagement right at this moment. Let us wish
them all success, victory and safe homecoming, meaning those fighting in the Kursk Region and along the entire
frontline.

Thank you.

Dmitry Kulko: Mr President, I have just returned from the Kursk Region. We have been working with the units and
formations you mentioned, which are currently undertaking the noble duty of liberating our homeland. For several
weeks, we have been on the front lines, filming reports. Notably, the 155th brigade has liberated several residential
areas, and we have discussed this.

Our reports illustrate that once the enemy is expelled from a residential area, they begin bombarding these streets
with drones and artillery, almost as if in retaliation. We visited the recently liberated Borki, Snagost, and
Lyubimovka. The footage clearly shows the houses intact initially, only to be targeted by Ukrainian shells
afterwards. Consequently, the residents of this border region now find themselves with nowhere to return to and are
striving to build new lives somehow.

I propose we connect with Tatyana Zibrova by telephone. She is currently residing in temporary accommodation in
the Kursk Region. Ms Zibrova, can you hear us?

Tatyana Zibrova: Yes, I can hear you.

Dmitry Kulko: Please direct your question to the President.

Tatyana Zibrova: Good afternoon, Mr President.

Vladimir Putin: Hello.

Tatyana Zibrova: I am a resident of the Kursk Region, Bolshesoldatsky District.

I have a question on behalf of all residents of the Kursk Region. When will our region be fully liberated? When will
the Ukrainian armed forces be pushed back so far that they will not even dare to show themselves or look in our
direction? When will we be able to return to our homes or have our own accommodation somewhere?

Additionally, will the small villages that were destroyed be rebuilt, and will infrastructure be restored? The residents
of Bolshesoldatsky District are particularly concerned: will we be included on the list of those eligible to receive

                                                                                                           Page 9 of 62
                              

housing certificates? Currently, we are not receiving them, as the Ukrainian armed forces have not directly invaded
us and we are not on the list for certificates.

Vladimir Putin: Ms Zibrova, rest assured. I cannot and do not want to provide a specific date as to when they will
be driven out. Our troops are engaged in combat right now, and the battles are intense. As I have mentioned
before, there was no strategic military reason for the Ukrainian armed forces to enter the Kursk Region or to hold
their position there as they are, deploying their elite assault groups and units to no avail. Yet, this situation persists.

We will undoubtedly drive them out. There is no alternative. Concerning a precise date - I am afraid I cannot specify
one at this moment. I have an understanding of the plans, which are regularly reported to me. However, it is not
possible to declare a specific date. The troops can hear me now; if I were to specify a date, they would go to great
lengths to meet it, potentially disregarding casualties. We cannot allow that. While a day or two may not make a
significant difference, but we will undoubtedly expel them, the damage assessment will follow, and, most
importantly, everything will be restored. There is no doubt about that.

We will rebuild the road network, restore utility infrastructure, and reinstate social facilities such as schools and
kindergartens. Community centres and housing will be rebuilt, and housing reconstruction certificates will be issued.

We will assist those who wish to relocate to other regions. Currently, about 108 billion rubles have been allocated
for this purpose, if I remember correctly. I know that the first funds have already been received. The Administration
will work throughout the holidays, meeting with people and addressing their issues, including providing certificates.

I understand that what is happening is incredibly challenging for you: people are experiencing heavy losses,
inconveniences, especially families with children. But rest assured, we will do everything in our power to restore
everything. Everyone in need of housing assistance will be fully satisfied; everyone will receive what they are
entitled to.

I genuinely hope that the new head of the region, who has been appointed to the Kursk Region, is experienced and
capable of effectively working with people. That is why I chose him, he has a long history of working in the State
Duma and directly with his voters, so he knows how to handle it. I expect that he will work with every person on an
individual basis.

Dmitry Kulko: Mr President, our military personnel who are currently liberating the Kursk Region do not have the
status of a participant in the special military operation.

Vladimir Putin: Pardon?

Dmitry Kulko: They don't have the status of a participant in the special military operation.

Vladimir Putin: Why?

Dmitry Kulko: Because they are participants in the counter-terrorism operation. This also affects the payments they
receive.

We received several requests, mostly from the wives of the military personnel: "My husband serves in an assault
company in the Kursk Region and is carrying out combat missions. In October and November, he received a pay
allowance of 42,000 rubles, even though he is on battle positions. Many soldiers have not received combat daily
payments for three or four months. It has been argued that they are in the zone of a counter-terrorism operation, not
the special military operation."

Another appeal: "In the Kursk Region, they are paid a monthly salary of 25,000 rubles, not the 210,000 rubles
promised in the Ministry of Defence contracts."

Can this situation be corrected?

                                                                                                      Page 10 of 62
                             

Vladimir Putin: It can and should be rectified. This is a mistake on our part. That is no news to me. I understand
what you are talking about.

Our servicemen who fought in other parts of the front are recognised as combatants. If they have been transferred
to the Kursk Region, they should receive all the payments they are entitled to. I will look into this.

There might be a category of individuals who had not previously participated at all or had not been on the front lines
and were deployed to the Kursk Region from the very beginning, so they were not classified as participants in the
special military operation.

To be honest, it never occurred to me, and I apologise for that. This will be corrected. It is unfortunate that the
military department did not pay attention to this either; after all, it primarily falls under their responsibility.

We will correct everything, and all servicemen who are carrying out their duty to the Motherland on the line of
contact will receive all payments due to them. We will recalculate retroactively.

Dmitry Kulko: Thank you very much.

Vladimir Putin: Absolutely, without a doubt.

Dmitry Kulko: I personally know a few soldiers who are eager to get an answer right now.

Vladimir Putin: Yes, and I want the fighters to hear me. Please, do not worry, and do not let your families worry
about it: everything will be recalculated, and all the due payments, including the benefits for combat action, every
payment to which you are entitled will be made.

Dmitry Kulko: Mr President, you have already said today that the Armed Forces of Ukraine are sending their special
forces for slaughter in the Kursk Region. Indeed, their losses are enormous; this much is quite obvious. To be
honest, I have never seen so many abandoned enemy bodies - indeed, all the local forests are littered with them. I
do not even have to mention all the destroyed NATO equipment, including Abrams, Bradley, Leopard vehicles.
They say the Kursk Region, its soil, is now the world's biggest burial place of NATO equipment, and that is actually
true.

Vladimir Putin: Possibly.

Dmitry Kulko: However, there is one small point to make here.

Vladimir Putin: As far as I know, the number of armoured vehicles destroyed in the Kursk Region has now
exceeded the number of vehicles destroyed on the entire line of contact last year - in any case, these are
comparable figures.

Dmitry Kulko: Please, could I ask, could I put in a word for the fighters, for those who destroyed that equipment: will
they receive the promised reward?

Vladimir Putin: For the damaged equipment?

Dmitry Kulko: Yes.

Vladimir Putin: Of course, they should. Are there any problems with this?

Dmitry Kulko: To be honest, they are facing some difficulties.

Vladimir Putin: That is surprising. I know that the Defence Minister is listening to our conversation now, and this
will definitely be done. No one should have any doubt about this.

Dmitry Kulko: Thank you.

                                                                                                      Page 11 of 62
                             

Dmitry Peskov: Shall we move on to questions from the audience?

Vladimir Putin: Yes.

Dmitry Peskov: Since we are talking about military issues, let's start with the Zvezda television channel.

Konstantin Kokoveshnikov: Good afternoon.

Konstantin Kokoveshnikov, Zvezda TV channel.

Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon.

Konstantin Kokoveshnikov: I cannot but ask you about the statements that we have heard over the past few weeks
concerning the footage of the first combat tests of the latest Oreshnik missile, which has been shown all over the
world. One gets the impression that it really has no drawbacks, but the West continues to refer to Oreshnik as a
modification of old Soviet weapons, claiming that this missile can be shot down by air defence even at the launch
stage.

How would you comment on this? Does it have any shortcomings?

If you do not mind, I have a clarifying question: what meaning did the creators of the Oreshnik put into the name -
hazel tree? There are several versions.

Vladimir Putin: First, regarding how old or new and modern this weapon is. It is a modern, a brand new weapon.
All new achievements in any sphere are based on the designs and achievements made in the past, which people
use to move forward. This is also true about the Oreshnik system.

Yes, it is based on previous designs, but these designs were made in the contemporary Russian period. Our
scientists, designers and engineers used that basis to create something new, coordinating their activities with the
Defence Ministry as the contractor. When I was ultimately informed about that system, I joined the discussions on
whether to make it or not, in what quantities, when and how.

It is a new system. As I have said, it is an intermediate- and shorter-range system.

You have said that some Western experts believe that this missile can be easily shot down and destroyed,
especially in the boost phase of the missile trajectory.

What would I tell those experts? There are several types of air defence systems, as you know being from the
Zvezda TV channel, such as Patriot and the more modern THAAD systems. I do not know if Ukraine has them, but I
do not think so. If the Americans want, they can send its THAAD systems to Ukraine. These are more modern
systems similar to our S-400 systems. The Patriot systems are comparable to our S-300s, while THAAD is similar
to our S-400 systems, if only slightly inferior.

Let them send these systems to Ukraine, and we will ask our people in Ukraine to tell us about the modern
solutions of these systems which we could use. I am not joking when I say "our people," because there are people
in Ukraine who you can talk to, there are many of such people who are dreaming, together with us, about liberating
their country from the neo-Nazi regime.

There are also other strike systems such as the ballistic missile system (BMD), which used to be a hot topic of our
discussions. We once asked the Americans not to deploy that system so that we would not have to create weapons
that would be able to avoid it.

We have eventually done that. We have created the Avangard glide vehicle, which does not fly by a specific
trajectory but hugs the terrain, without going up into space, because it is not a ballistic missile. We have done a
great deal to evade air defence systems.

                                                                                                        Page 12 of 62
                             

Overall, this whole story is an expensive product for the American taxpayers that can do little to ensure national
security. However, that system has been created and produced in large quantities.

Two missile launching areas have been established in Romania and Poland, respectively. Around 24 missile
interceptors are already deployed at each site. I don't remember but I think they are called Standard Missile-3
systems. Standard Missile-3 Block 1B missiles are deployed in Romania. They have an effective range of 300
kilometres and can hit targets 80 to 250 km above the ground.

Even more formidable weapon systems are deployed in Poland, with a range and altitude of 1,000 and 500 km.
However, our medium-range Oreshnik missile system can strike targets located 1,000, 1,500, 3,000-plus and up to
5,500 km away. Such is its range.

Supposing our system is located 2,000 km away, the missile interceptors on Polish territory would be unable to hit
it. Yes, they say that the missiles are quite vulnerable during the initial boost phase. First, nothing will reach those
missile bases, even if they are unprotected. And, of course, we are shielding them. Nothing can hit them. There are
no systems capable of reaching these bases.

Second, it takes time to travel this distance, while our missile needs a few second to start dispensing warheads,
and that's it, the ship has sailed. There is almost no chance of shooting down these missiles.

If the Western experts you mentioned think otherwise, they should suggest to those in the West and the United
States who are paying them for their analytical services to conduct a certain technological experiment, a high-tech
21st-century duel.

Let them choose a target in Kiev, deploy all their air defence and missile defence forces there, and we will hit that
target using an Oreshnik missile. We shall see what happens.

We are ready to conduct this experiment. Is the other side ready? In any event, we do not rule this out. What I want
to say is that all of their air defence and ABM systems are operating.

It would be interesting for us. I am telling you what engineers, scientists and military specialists are telling me. They
are also telling some things at the level of the US political leadership.

Let us hold this experiment, this technological duel, and see what happens. This would be interesting and I believe
it would be useful for both us and the US side.

Konstantin Kokoveshnikov: Why this name?

Dmitry Peskov: Why this name?

Vladimir Putin: Honestly? I do not know.

Dmitry Peskov: Let's take one more question from the audience. Let's go over there. I can see. Rossiyskaya
Gazeta. A question on peace perhaps?

Aisel Gereikhanova: Rossiyskaya Gazeta, Aisel Gereikhanova.

Mr President, you signed an executive order changing the nuclear doctrine recently. Do you think the West correctly
took the signal and understood it properly?

Vladimir Putin: I don't know how they took it. You should ask them about it. I know what constitutes these changes
- and it is not a new doctrine but actual changes. I will name some key aspects. We are talking about some new
military hazards that may grow into military threats. They include missile defence systems and some other things
that we list.

Then we speak about increasing the responsibility of non-nuclear states that may participate in an aggression
against the Russian Federation alongside the countries that have nuclear weapons. If, like their allies, these

                                                                                                     Page 13 of 62
                            

countries also pose a threat to our sovereignty and Russia's existence, then we imply that we have the right to use
our nuclear weapons against them.

Finally, another component related to nuclear arms management, and another, fourth important aspect is that we
declared that, if similar threats are posed to Belarus, our ally and member of the Union State, the Russian
Federation will consider these threats as threats to Russia. And we will do everything to ensure the security of
Belarus. We do this upon agreement with the Belarusian leadership and President of Belarus Alexander
Lukashenko. I believe it is a very important component of the updated nuclear strategy of the Russian Federation.

Alexandra Suvorova: Mr Peskov, let's take one more question from the audience. I can see that you are holding the
microphone.

Dmitry Peskov: Sure.

Darya Shuchalina: Mr President, please give the floor to the Arctic.

Dmitry Peskov: We agreed not to shout out questions and respect each other.

Vladimir Putin: Right, let's not shout and please be respectful. But we will listen to the Arctic. Let's do what the
boss says.

Darya Shuchalina: Good afternoon, Mr President, Darya Shuchalina, Republic of Komi, Respublika newspaper.

First of all, thank you very much for returning our fellow Komi man, Rostislav Goldshtein. He is now Acting Head of
Komi and let's just say he immediately got down to business because he knows the region very well. Thank you for
your choice.

Vladimir Putin: He is a good manager and an empathetic person, stable and organised. I hope he will succeed.

Darya Shuchalina: Thank you for your choice.

Now, to proposals. In the Russian Arctic territories, in the Far East and in the Far North, as well as in the Republic
of Komi, there are many residential areas with up to 2,000 residents. Unfortunately, these residential areas are not
eligible for a very good state programme on construction of cinemas.

We know that people in the North are dedicated to their home regions; they are not moving to bigger cities and
instead serving their country in their towns and villages. There are not many entertainment opportunities in the
North. At this moment in time, when the patriotic film industry is growing in Russia, it would be great to have this
criterion amended in the law and ensure that northern residential areas with a population of up to 2,000 residents
be eligible for this programme. So that residents would be able to go and see films in comfortable modern cinemas.

As for the poster I am holding, you worked in our region as a member of a student construction brigade in your
younger years, so you know that this Soviet-era mechanism was very effective. Unfortunately, today there is no
legal framework for it.

Would it be possible to amend Federal Law No 44 regarding state and municipal contracts for budget-funded
construction projects so that these student construction brigades can carry out at least 10 to 15 percent of
contractual work? This way, young people can gain valuable work experience and earn some money. Companies
could also benefit from these human resources, and this could serve as a development driver for the regions since
they would be able to build social infrastructure they need.

Vladimir Putin: Could you repeat, please: where do these 10 percent come from?

Daria Shuchalina: I was talking about municipalities and regions reserving a specific share in construction contracts
for student construction brigades.

Vladimir Putin: I see. You mean allocating some of the funds from the construction sector to these mechanisms?

                                                                                                       Page 14 of 62
                             

Daria Shuchalina: Yes.

Vladimir Putin: I will discuss this with Mr Khusnullin. I think it is quite possible. We are currently working to revive
this movement, it is re-emerging. I think this has already happened - I am referring to the student construction
brigades as a movement.

The funding mechanism you described could probably be an option, and I think it has already been adopted, but let
me check with Marat Khusnullin. I will raise this issue with him. Agreed?

Daria Shuchalina: I also had a question about cinemas.

Vladimir Putin: Right. Was it about gyms or cinemas?

Daria Shuchalina: I was talking about cinemas.

Vladimir Putin: What a surprising question, at least for me, you know.

Regarding the Arctic zone, let me tell you, first, that we have kept subsidised mortgages at a rate of two percent for
this region, as well as for Russia's Far East. The Arctic can still benefit from two percent mortgages, and I believe
this is something that matters a great deal for people there who have been eager to use this subsidy. We have also
kept this two percent mortgage rate for the new territories. This is my first point.

Second, we have an entire programme for specific communities in this zone - I think that it covers 25 cities and
metropolitan areas - and we will expand it to a nationwide effort covering 200 cities.

We are talking about small communities here. They may fall through the cracks of the initiatives to develop these 25
metropolitan areas and cities. Of course, we will try to come up with additional measures for these smaller
communities and for the Arctic zone in general. It goes without saying that this is very important since most of them
have a rather small population.

It could be that there was an idea that providing them with broadband internet and so forth would suffice. That said,
I do agree with you that watching a film in a movie theatre creates a different kind of atmosphere, a special mood, if
you will. I will look into this issue. Note taken.

Daria Shuchalina: Especially considering that we now have all these great Russian patriotic films...

Vladimir Putin: Indeed. But this is a separate topic. Many producers are leaving Russia, and we wish them well,
nonetheless. But this has served as a development driver, including for the film industry. This is a fact.

History-themed films are very important too, considering the enthusiasm we are witnessing in our society and its
unifying potential. We are witnessing a revival of our fairy tales, epic sagas and alike. I enjoy watching these films
sometimes together with the small children in our family.

You are right. Note taken. We will try to find a way not to leave your request without a response.

Dmitry Peskov: Let's take another question from the audience and continue.

Dear friends, with all due respect, by asking two questions in a row, you are depriving some of your colleagues of
the opportunity to ask their questions.

Vladimir Putin: Do not mind Mr Peskov, go ahead with your question.

Dmitry Peskov: Let's proceed this way, then.

Krasnoyarsk.

Dmitry Novikov: Good afternoon.

                                                                                                          Page 15 of 62
                              

I am Dmitry Novikov with Yenisei TV channel, Krasnoyarsk.

Mr President, you once referred to Krasnoyarsk as the centre of Russia. The city is now preparing to celebrate its
400th anniversary.

Vladimir Putin: Sorry to interrupt, please do not take offense. I did not call it that way; it is, in fact, the geographical
centre of Russia.

Dmitry Novikov: Yes, of course. The city is going to mark its 400th anniversary in 2028, and we would like to take
this opportunity to invite you to join us in Krasnoyarsk for the celebration.

My question is this: the headquarters of RusHydro is currently relocating to Krasnoyarsk, following your initiative.
Wouldn't it be logical to extend this approach to other companies, not only state-owned but also private
businesses? For the region, this would mean additional tax revenues and new opportunities for development. Are
you considering this possibility?

Thank you.

Vladimir Putin: Yes.

Firstly, I believe this is a very appropriate approach. Relocating certain entities, including federal bodies, to various
regions of the country can stimulate development.

For example, we are working to consolidate the judicial branch in St Petersburg. This approach is common in some
countries and serves to separate the judiciary from the Presidential Executive Office and the Government, making it
more independent geographically. In this case, it also enhances St Petersburg's role as a functional capital city.

Other regional centres, such as Krasnoyarsk, certainly benefit from having a stronger tax base tied to local
production. Ensuring that taxes are paid at the site of economic activity provides a boost to regional development.

We are committed to advancing this initiative, though the process is complex.

Regarding RusHydro, when Viktor Maryin was being considered for the leadership role, I asked him directly if he
was prepared to relocate to Krasnoyarsk. His response was, "Yes." I followed up with, "What about your wife?" to
which he replied, "She will agree."

This process takes time, as you can understand. The necessary personnel need to be in place. Relocating people
from Moscow is challenging, not because they are lazy or unwilling to move to Siberia, but due to other
considerations like children, schools, kindergartens, universities and other family matters. It is indeed a difficult
process. Personnel need to be trained on site. However, efforts are underway, and RusHydro is in the process of
relocating.

We will also work hard so that major corporations and, I repeat, certain other government bodies move to other
regions of Russia. This is a vast country - the world's biggest, in fact. Of course, we must ensure that major
manufacturing hubs, corporations and government institutions are spread out across its territory. However, there
are also certain limits here, since the President and the Government must be close to one another as they must
work closely together.

Nevertheless, we must pursue this path, and this is what we will try to do.

Thank you very much for the invitation.

Alexandra Suvorova: There were business leaders who went as far as to suggest moving the capital to
Krasnoyarsk. This is something they have discussed.

                                                                                                         Page 16 of 62
                              

Vladimir Putin: There was Krasnoyarsk, and Irkutsk too. In fact, remember Peter the Great? What did he want to
do? He wanted a capital in the south, and was choosing between St Petersburg and Taganrog, a southern city. He
wanted to move the capital to Taganrog. At the outset, he wanted to have the capital of the Empire in Taganrog.

Dmitry Peskov: Mr President, excuse me, but I spotted Andrei Rudenko, our war correspondent from Donetsk. I feel
that I must give him the floor.

Vladimir Putin: Go ahead, Andrei.

Andrei Rudenko: Mr President, I have been working as a war correspondent in Donbass since 2014. Today, I am
heading Donetsk State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company.

Here is my question, and it is quite a serious one. There is a massive reconstruction effort underway across
Donbass, as well as in the Kherson and Zaporozhye regions. However, the war continues in our region. Our troops
are gaining ground, while the enemy keeps destroying cities and villages. Do we have the strength and the
resources we need for rebuilding and restoring our historical territories after recovering them?

Vladimir Putin: We do. Make no mistake about that. We have a large-scale programme for rebuilding and
developing these territories until 2030. We have already embarked on this effort, and it will carry on across several
domains, which include rebuilding roads, housing, putting utilities back into operation, as well as social and cultural
infrastructure.

Speaking of roads, our plan consists of bringing the entire road network in these regions in compliance with
Russia's national standards within three years. You come from this region, and you know that this effort is already
underway. There is a very useful and feasible initiative to build a ring road circling the Sea of Azov, which is now
part of Russia's internal waters. It will be just as good as the Tavrida motorway in Crimea, with four lanes and all the
amenities a highway of this kind must offer.

Part of this road has already been built, even if it is just the beginning. It is quite short, just 40 kilometres, and runs
from Taganrog to Mariupol. However, our plan consists of extending it to create a full circle around the Sea of Azov.
There is also another road linking Mariupol to Donetsk. It is almost 100 kilometres long, or 97, to be more precise, if
I am not mistaken. We will restore the road network in its entirety.

As I have said, the funds have been earmarked. Some social facilities have been finished and put into operation,
like a world-class perinatal centre in Donetsk and a medical centre in Mariupol. A large children's hospital is to be
built in the south of the Zaporozhye Region. Local residents have submitted that request, and the governor insisted
that they need it. I believe that this project is at the design stage. We will certainly build it.

Overall, we have big plans in these spheres until 2030. We have rebuilt 21,000 facilities, 11,000 of which have been
financed from the federal budget and 10,000 from the budgets of regions across the Russian Federation that are
overseeing these projects.

I would like to use this occasion, and looking directly into the camera, to express gratitude to the heads and people
of these regions for their selfless and tremendous assistance. It is a national mission. I mentioned the projects that
have been completed, but we need to restore and rebuild another 20,000 facilities within five or six years, and we
will do so.

Andrei Rudenko: Mr President, I would like to say the following about the Lugansk People's Republic, which never
had good roads under the Ukrainian government. Today, the roads are ideal throughout the Lugansk People's
Republic. Our people are extremely grateful for this.

Vladimir Putin: This is the basic thing, which we can and must do. We will do more.

As for individual regions, I would like to address people in these regions and throughout Russia, so that everyone in
the country knows that these regions have good development potential and large tax potential. I believe that tax
collection in the Lugansk People's Republic has increased by 97 percent. The relevant figure for Donbass as a

                                                                                                        Page 17 of 62
                              

whole is 69 percent. The tax collection in the Zaporozhye and Kherson regions has increased several-fold. The
figures themselves are smaller there because their tax base is smaller, but the collection of taxes has increased
manyfold, by more than 200 percent. In other words, their tax base is good, their revival is rapid, and these regions
are approaching the level of self-sufficiency.

It is true that we need to support people, providing assistance and giving a helping hand at the right time. Our
country is doing so and will continue doing so until these regions' complete incorporation into Russia not only in
legal terms but also in terms of social and economic development.

Alexandra Suvorova: Mr Putin, I have a follow-up question. Did you mean tax collection when you spoke about
taxes in these regions?

Vladimir Putin: Yes, I meant the collection of taxes.

As I have said, I could be wrong but the collection of taxes has increased by about 79 percent in Donetsk, over 90
percent in Lugansk, and over 200 percent in Kherson and Zaporozhye regions. The absolute figures are smaller in
the latter two regions because the tax base is smaller there, but it is an upward trend, and it is stable.

Alexandra Suvorova: Incidentally, we are receiving a lot of different questions from the new regions, particularly
concerning the calculation of pensions.

The point is that often, the length of work in Ukraine is not being taken into account. People simply don't have the
supporting documents.

Let us now turn our attention to a video message from pensioner Leonid Shipilov.

Vladimir Putin: Please.

Leonid Shipilov: My name is Leonid Shipilov, I am a pensioner from Krasny Liman. I have an employment record
spanning 45 years. Currently, I live in Donetsk with my daughter, due to the ongoing hostilities in Krasny Liman.

In May 2022, my home was destroyed in a shelling, resulting in the loss of my employment record book.
Consequently, I am unable to secure a fair recalculation of my pension. The only document that could verify my
employment history is the OK-5 certificate.

In July of this year, I submitted this certificate to the Pension Fund in the Kalininsky District of Donetsk, yet I still
have not received a response.

I appeal to you for assistance in clarifying this matter.

Vladimir Putin: Mr Shipilov, these may appear to be everyday issues, yet they have great importance to people. I
fully understand this, as it is essential to validate one's employment history. Previously, it was challenging to do so,
but a recent legislative change has been enacted, recognising all prior employment records, even from years or
decades past. I believe the pertinent federal law was enacted in November. Therefore, there are now regulatory
and legal frameworks in place to address your concern.

All such matters, even in the absence of documents, can be resolved through witness testimonies and the decisions
of interdepartmental regional commissions. I urge the republic's authorities to streamline their work in a way that
ensures that these issues are resolved without unnecessary red tape.

I recently spoke with Denis Pushilin, the head of the Donetsk People's Republic. He mentioned hosting a delegation
from Africa. We are delighted to welcome our friends and guests, and he himself is planning a visit to Africa, which
is commendable and necessary for maintaining relations. However, I would like to remind him of Mr Shipilov, who
also requires attention. I trust that the interdepartmental regional commissions will be duly organised. I reiterate,
especially since a legal foundation for this is now in place: the relevant federal law has been adopted.

                                                                                                        Page 18 of 62
                             

Alexandra Suvorova: Indeed, there are numerous queries regarding the loss of documents. This issue extends
beyond pensions to include education and property titles. I would like to share a few more messages.

Vladimir Putin: As I have mentioned before, these matters are resolved through the decisions of interdepartmental
commissions and based on what is termed witness testimony. We are not talking about legal proceedings, but
rather obtaining reliable information from neighbours, former colleagues, and so forth.

Alexandra Suvorova: Housing is another major issue in this region.

We have numerous appeals and calls that came from Mariupol from people who expected to receive housing as
compensation, but so far, that has proved problematic. I will quote a few of them.

"Mariupol needs help in building the compensatory housing," this text message says. "The new buildings were
completed last spring, but they have not been open for occupancy yet," Alexei Tsygankov writes - this is one of the
appeals.

In fact, there are many of them - these are just a few that we have selected.

Vladimir Putin: We are paying a lot of attention to Mariupol, which it certainly deserves, as it is a large city. Before
the outbreak of hostilities, it was home to about 430,000 people. Local authorities are telling me there were even
more people than that, closer to 470,000. More than 3,000 apartment buildings [may be needed] there. I have
visited Mariupol; I know this, and my colleagues from the Government report to me regularly. About 1,700
multifamily houses have been rebuilt, but not all of them have been commissioned yet. Paperwork needs to be
completed on more than 500 projects, but the buildings are already there.

What is the situation there? Residential buildings are being repaired or rebuilt. Where a building cannot be repaired,
local authorities make the decision to demolish it and allocate the land for commercial development. Once
developers build new housing there, buyers can purchase apartments with a mortgage at 2 percent.

Home loans with 2-percent interest continue to be available in Russia's new regions. In fact, that has triggered quite
a construction boom there. According to our estimates, at least 300,000 people have returned to Mariupol, and its
population continues to grow rapidly.

We are also working to improve local roads, schools, social and cultural facilities, and healthcare - a large medical
centre has recently opened there - and educational institutions. We will certainly continue this work. As for housing,
again, many projects have been allocated to commercial developers. However, the local residents are entitled to
new housing as near as possible to the place where they used to live. Better still, if their building has been repaired,
they should be given apartments there. If a development company is building a new multifamily house in its place,
they need to ensure that former residents receive new housing in the area, not on the outskirts or even outside the
city boundary. There are 5,000 ownerless apartments in the city. Local authorities need to stop holding them, but to
distribute them among people - legally, of course. It is important to bear in mind that people are still returning, so we
need to give some thought to the procedure. But these issues must be addressed.

One thing I can say for sure: everyone who has the right to compensation will receive a compensation. If not,
please contact the relevant authorities at the local or federal levels. I believe there are decision-making centres at
both levels; they have been created. If my memory serves me correctly, the relevant agencies are located on
Marata Street. Marat Khusnullin has reported this to me.

Alexandra Suvorova: It is easy to remember.

Vladimir Putin: It is easy to remember. If I am mot mistaken, I think they are there.

Dmitry Kulko: Mr President, speaking of the southern regions, I would like to highlight the environmental impact
caused by the sinking of two tankers during a storm in the Kerch Strait.

                                                                                                        Page 19 of 62
                             

The petroleum products were washed ashore, onto a beach near Anapa. Currently, the pollution is spreading in the
direction of Gelendzhik.

The situation is worsening. Currently, the Emergencies Ministry staff, volunteers, and local residents are involved in
the cleanup effort. They are making videos, posting footage on social media, and have sent a few to our
programme. Let us take a look.

Vladimir Putin: Please.

(A video clip rolls.)

Dmitry Kulko: Mr President, these harrowing images come from a beach resort. I am aware of the fact that you
ordered to clean things up as soon as possible. Is there any way to speed up this process and minimise the impact?

Vladimir Putin: First, this is, of course, an environmental disaster. This is absolutely clear. Law enforcement
agencies are in the process of assessing the ship captains' actions. I was informed that, in their opinion, the
captains violated certain rules and failed to seek shelter in time. Other ships found safe spots before the storm and
are doing just fine, but these did not and dropped anchors in the wrong places. Let the relevant services within the
Ministry of Transport and law enforcement agencies deal with it. That is my first point.

I am not sure what is happening right now, but the 4- to 5-point storm raged on yesterday, posing a challenge to
relief efforts. I think, by Saturday, the sea will calm down, and cleanup operations can proceed more effectively.

Second, the reason I call this a major disaster is because almost 40 percent of the fuel spilled, which is an
established fact. Some tankers have submerged, some have sunk, and others remain partially submerged near the
shore. We need to address this.

Various services are at work, including the Ministry of Natural Resources, the Ministry of Transport, and the
Emergencies Ministry. This work must be coordinated. I asked the Prime Minister to set up a working group headed
by Deputy Prime Minister in charge of transport Vitaly Savelyev. All services are at work, and I receive regular
updates on the developments.

We need to study the tankers' condition. We also need to think about the steps we need to take in the near future.
This issue must be addressed in stages.

Stage one: Right now, we must contain the spill with containment booms to prevent the spill from spreading further.

Stage two: The fuel that has washed ashore must be removed. Governor (of the Krasnodar Territory) Veniamin
Kondratiev reported to me yesterday or the day before yesterday saying that he had about 4,000 people working in
the area. According to him, no additional measures are needed at the moment. However, we will, of course, deploy
more Emergencies Ministry teams, if needed.

This is the task at hand. We are dealing with fuel oil, which displays specific properties at certain temperatures. It is
a solid material that washes ashore and must be removed. However, a portion of this fuel oil has already settled on
the seabed, and by May, when the water temperature rises, it could resurface and wash ashore again. We must get
ready for that now. One way or the other, we need to remove the semi-submerged tankers from the water. These
tankers need to be secured now to prevent further leakage. We will need to use containment tools, known as
"towels," and later draft a project which is a major undertaking, and to pull the tankers with fuel on the shore.

This is a major effort. The Government is working on it, and I very much hope that no time will be wasted in
addressing it.

Mr President, if you don't mind, I see American journalists over there.

Vladimir Putin: Go ahead.

                                                                                                        Page 20 of 62
                             

Dmitry Peskov: I can see NBC News. Please.

Keir Simmons: Mr President, Keir Simmons, NBC News.

Two questions in English, if you don't mind. Sorry, Mr Peskov.

The first one is about President-elect Trump.

Mr President, you have failed to reach the objectives of your special military operation. Large numbers of Russians
have died, including a general assassinated here in Moscow this week. And the leader of Syria, who you supported,
has been overthrown.

Mr President, when you face President-elect Trump, you will be the weaker leader. How do you propose to
compromise? What are you going to offer?

And my second question, Mr President, is this: the mother of an American journalist who is missing in Syria, Austin
Tice, has written to you and asked for your help to try to find him because, she says, you have such connections
with the Syrian Government and former President Assad.

Are you prepared to ask President Assad for information about what happened in Syria to try to find the missing,
including this American journalist?

Vladimir Putin: Could you repeat the part of your question about the journalist? Where did the journalist
disappear? When and what happened to him there?

Keir Simmons: I have a letter here sent to you this week by the mother of an American journalist who is missing in
Syria. He has been missing for 12 years. He is called Austin Tice. In this letter, she is asking for your help to try to
find him because she says you have such close connections to the former Syrian Government, to President Assad.

Will you ask President Assad for information about the missing in Syria and about Austin Tice, this woman's son?
She says she is prepared to come to Moscow if it will help to find out anything she can about her son.

Vladimir Putin: I see. Please sit down.

Frankly, I have not met with President Bashar al-Assad after his arrival in Moscow. But I plan to do it and will
certainly talk to him.

We are adults and understand that the person disappeared in Syria 12 years ago. Twelve years. We realise what
was happening in Syria 12 years ago. The country was caught in active military action, on both sides. Does
President al-Assad know what happened to this American citizen, the journalist who, as far as I understand, was
working in the zone of hostilities? Nevertheless, I promise that I will definitely ask him this question just like we can
forward this question to the people who are controlling the situation on the ground in Syria today.

You asked what we can offer or what I can offer to newly elected President Trump when we meet.

First of all, I don't know when we will meet because he has not said anything about it. I have not talked to him for
more than four years. Of course, I'm ready to talk any time; I will be ready to meet with him if he wishes. You said
that this conversation will take place with me in some kind of weakened state.

Esteemed Mr Simmons. Why did I say "esteemed"? Because, despite all the persecution of Russian media, we
allow you to continue working in Russia and you can do so freely. It is good enough. You and the people who pay
your salary in the United States really want to see Russia in a weakened state.

My opinion differs. I believe that Russia has become significantly stronger in the past two or three years. Why?
Because we are becoming a truly sovereign country, and we barely depend on anybody. We are capable of firmly
standing on our feet when it comes to the economy. I have already talked about economic growth rates.

                                                                                                        Page 21 of 62
                             

We are strengthening our defence capability. The combat readiness of the Russian Armed Forces is the highest in
the world today. I assure you it is the highest.

The same is true of our defence industry. We are increasing the production of everything our army and navy need
now and will need in the future. We are doing so confidently and quickly, unlike our opponents.

I have already spoken about the successes of our armed forces, which are due in large measure to production
growth in the defence industry of the Russian Federation. As I have said, we are doing this confidently and quite
rationally.

It has been said that our forces are advancing along the front line. One explanation for this is the existence of the
equipment I have mentioned. Yes, in fact all NATO countries are fighting against us.

We spoke about our inflation. And what is the situation over there? Take a 155 mm shell, which cost 2,000 euros
two years ago and now costs four times more, 8,000 euros. If this trend persists, two percent of GDP spending on
defence in NATO countries, which President-elect Donald Trump always insisted on, will not suffice. Even three
percent will not be enough. The training and combat standards and the morale of the Russian armed forces are
higher than those of any other army in the world.

That is why I believe that Russia has largely achieved the state we wanted to achieve. It has grown stronger and
become a truly sovereign state, and we will make decisions without looking at other people's opinions, only with our
national interests in mind.

You have mentioned Syria. You and, as I said, those who pay your salary would like to present the current
developments in Syria as Russia's defeat. I assure you that this is not the case, and here is why. We came to Syria
ten years ago to prevent the creation of a terrorist enclave there, like the one that we saw in some other countries,
for example, Afghanistan. We have achieved that goal, by and large.

Even the groups that were fighting against the Assad regime and the government forces back then have undergone
internal changes. It is not surprising that many European countries and the United States are trying to develop
relations with them now. Would they be doing this if they were terrorist organisations? This means that they have
changed, doesn't it? So, our goal has been achieved, to a certain degree.

Next, we did not deploy any ground forces in Syria; they simply were not present there. Our presence consisted
solely of two bases: an air base and a naval base. The ground operations were conducted by the Syrian armed
forces and, as is widely known, there is no secret here, certain pro-Iranian combat units. At one point, we even
withdrew our special operations forces from the area. We were not engaged in combat there.

So, what transpired? When armed opposition groups advanced towards Aleppo, the city was defended by
approximately 30,000 personnel. However, when 350 militants entered the city, the government forces, along with
the pro-Iranian units, withdrew without resistance, demolishing their positions as they left. This pattern was
observed across nearly the entire Syrian territory, with only minor exceptions where skirmishes occurred. In the
past, our Iranian friends requested assistance to move their units into Syria; now they have asked us to help
withdraw them. We facilitated the relocation of 4,000 Iranian fighters to Tehran from the Khmeimim air base. Some
pro-Iranian units withdrew to Lebanon, others to Iraq, without engaging in combat.

The current situation in the Syrian Arab Republic remains challenging. We sincerely hope for peace and stability to
be restored. We maintain dialogue with all groups controlling the situation there and with all regional countries. An
overwhelming majority of them have expressed interest in retaining our military bases in Syria.

I do not know, we must reflect on how our relations will evolve with the political forces currently in control and those
that will govern this country in the future - our interests must align. Should we remain, we must act in the interests of
the host nation.

What will those interests entail? What can we do for them? These questions demand careful consideration on both
sides. We are already capable of offering assistance, including utilising our bases - we have extended this proposal

                                                                                                  Page 22 of 62
                             

to our partners within Syria and neighbouring nations. For instance, we suggested employing the Khmeimim air
base for the delivery of humanitarian aid to Syria, and this was met with understanding and a willingness to
collaborate. The same applies to the Tartus naval base.

Therefore, for those who wish to depict Russia as weakened... since you are an American, I would like to remind
you of a well-known writer who once remarked: "The reports of my death are greatly exaggerated."

Should there be an opportunity for a meeting with the newly elected President, Donald Trump, I am confident there
will be plenty to discuss.

Dmitry Kulko: Mr President, I would like to remind you of another question that my colleague asked about the
murder of General Kirillov.

Vladimir Putin: Yes, about the murder of General Kirillov.

You have mentioned this was an "attempted assassination." I thank you for this, because you have indirectly
acknowledged that it was a terrorist attack. Why? Because the modus operandi used by the perpetrator for this
murder endangered the lives of many.

The regime in Kiev has repeatedly committed similar crimes, acts of terror, and terrorist attacks against many
citizens of the Russian Federation, let alone what they are doing in Kursk now, firing at civilians - I mean in the
Kursk Region - and in other regions of Russia. They have killed journalists, your colleagues - committed terrorist
attacks against journalists.

However, we have never heard - I am not referring to you personally - anyone from the Western journalistic corps
openly condemn such attacks. But I am grateful to you for remembering this at least.

Dmitry Peskov: Let's engage with the audience some more.

Alexandra Suvorova: Go ahead.

Dmitry Peskov: They are showing great interest.

I see a 'Tatars. BRICS' poster. We were in Kazan just recently.

Vladimir Putin: I am sorry, I would like to address your American colleague. Can you hear me? If you have any
more questions, please ask.

Dmitry Peskov: Let's go back to Kazan now.

Vladimir Putin: All right.

Do you need some time to think? You can gather your thoughts while we talk to the Tatars. After that, we will talk
with the Americans.

Dmitry Peskov: Go ahead, please.

Keir Simmons: My question is, are you prepared to compromise in anyway over Ukraine? You say that Kiev should
compromise, the Ukrainians should compromise, but what are you prepared to offer in the potential negotiations
potentially led by President-elect Trump?

Vladimir Putin: I apologise for missing this part of your question, which is very important.

Politics is the art of compromise. We have always said that we are ready for both negotiations and compromises.
The problem is that the opposing side, both literally and figuratively, rejected negotiations. We, on the contrary,
have always been willing to talk, and talking always leads to finding a compromise.

                                                                                                    Page 23 of 62
                             

We did reach an agreement in Istanbul in late 2022. I repeat for the umpteenth time: the Ukrainian side initialled
that document, which meant that generally, it agreed with what it contained. Suddenly they wanted out. It is clear
why. Because your ally, Mr Johnson, the man with an iconic hairstyle, told them they were to fight to the last
Ukrainian. This is what they are doing. They will soon run out of Ukrainians who want to fight. I believe there will
soon be no one left who wants to fight.

So, we are ready, but we need that country to be ready for both negotiations and compromise.

Dmitry Peskov: Thank you.

Kazan, please.

Vladimir Putin: We have talked with the Americans, now we will talk with the Tatars.

Artur Khalilullov: Good afternoon, Mr President.

Thank you for the opportunity to ask my question. I am Artur Khalilullov from Tatar Inform.

BRICS has obviously been taken to a fundamentally new level after the Kazan summit. In fact, I cannot even
remember that dozens of world leaders, including Xi Jinping and Narendra Modi, gathered in Moscow.

Have your expectations regarding opposition to the Western world order materialised? That was my first question.

I also have a follow-up question. Last year, you told me personally in response to my question that Tatarstan is an
example of peaceful coexistence of different cultures, nations and religions. The same can be said about BRICS,
because BRICS is a group of widely different countries. This brings me to my question. Do you think that Kazan
could become the seat of the BRICS headquarters? Of BRICS as a whole or its Russian part?

Thank you.

Vladimir Putin: Artur, you have said that so many world leaders have never met in Moscow. This is correct, they
did not, but they have met in Kazan. So, we are grateful to Kazan for giving us this opportunity. This is the first
point.

Second, we are not planning to establish a headquarters now. There are several instruments that have been
created and are working in the interests of our group. But we will certainly make use of the possibilities offered by
the capital of Tatarstan, which have been created there over the past decades.

Kazan has made an astonishing leap in its development. I believe, and it is not an exaggeration, that Kazan is one
of the best cities in Europe. I am pleased to say so. We are proud of Moscow, which is one of the largest and best
mega-cities in the world, but Kazan is developing very rapidly and actively.

I remember visiting it with Mintimer Shaimiyev. I have told before that we entered a mud hut on the outskirts of
Kazan, a real mud hut where people lived. It was a deep hole with a roof above it. However, as is typical of the
Tatar culture, it was very clean, and there was tasty chak-chak fried dough dessert on the table.

You will not see anything like this in Kazan now. The city is developing. It is beautiful, and it even has a metro
system. I talked with Mr Shaimiyev back then that this needed to be done, and it has been done. Your new leader,
Rustam Minnikhanov, has taken over the baton and is working very effectively.

Overall, people in Kazan and Tatarstan as a whole are talented. They come from different ethnic groups, but they
live in peace and accord with each other, respect each other and their traditions, and I know that they attend each
other's religious feasts. You are doing this very well. I congratulate you on this.

There is another aspect that I would like to highlight.

                                                                                                        Page 24 of 62
                             

You said that BRICS has evolved into a tool for countering the West. This is not true; you are mistaken. BRICS is
not a tool for countering the West. Our work is not aimed against anyone. We focus on our own interests and the
interests of the group's member countries. Giving BRICS any kind of a confrontational agenda is not what we are
after.

This group has grown within a very short period of time and expanded its ranks. As you know, and we have
mentioned this many times, so I will not repeat it to save time, many countries have expressed interest in
developing the BRICS format.

Why? Because ensuring reciprocity, mutual respect and respecting each other's interests have been our core
guiding principles in this effort. We adopt all decisions by consensus, which is a very important point. There are no
small or big countries within BRICS, no countries that are more or less developed: this is a group based on
common interests. And there is one common interest: development. We try to identify available tools and create
new ones for generating more economic growth and transforming the structure of the economy in order for it to be
in step with the global development agenda, ensuring that BRICS countries and the group as a whole are at the
forefront of this progressive movement. This is the way we will be operating.

Thank you very much.

Dmitry Peskov: I suggest that we take another question from the audience.

I see an unconventional media outlet. It is quite new and rather popular too. Readovka, please go ahead with your
question.

Vladimir Putin: What was the title again?

Maxim Dolgov: Good afternoon, Mr President.

Maxim Dolgov, Readovka.

Here is my question. Many countries have been facing the issue of ageing and population decline these days, and
Russia is no exception. It is interesting that there have been all these measures to increase the birthrate, and you
have recently signed a law establishing the Council for Demographic and Family Policy. But if these laws fall short
of their promise, what will we do?

Thank you.

Vladimir Putin: We will improve them.

Take your seat, please.

This is an extremely important matter. In fact, this is one of the key issues for Russia, and not only for our country.
You were right to say that demography has become a matter of grave concern not only for Russia, but also for
many countries around the world.

The Soviet Union was able to achieve replacement-level fertility of two points. What does the fertility rate mean? It
stands for the number of children per woman. There was a time in the history of the Soviet Union when the fertility
rate was equal to two. And there was a time in Russia's recent past when we reached a rate of 1.7. Unfortunately, it
fell to 1.41. Is this a lot or a little? Of course, it is very little. However, there are other countries facing a similar
situation and located in a similar region. This includes Finland, where the birthrate is even lower, and I think Norway
is at the same level. The fertility rate in Spain is lower, and this is also true for many other countries. In some
developed countries, for example, in Japan, it is even lower than that, and South Korea has a fertility rate as low as
0.7. This is terrible. We have a slightly better situation in Russia, but just to reach the replacement fertility rate we
must have 2.1 children per woman, and we need at least 2.3 for our population to grow.

                                                                                                       Page 25 of 62
                             

I have said many times before what happened during the previous decades. There was a sharp decline in birth rate
during the Great Patriotic War, especially in 1943-1944, and then, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the birth
rate sank again similarly.

What happened next? I will take a couple of minutes to explain. When a low-numbered generation reaches the
reproductive age, it reproduces in similarly low numbers. These two birth rate decline trends - the trend of the Great
Patriotic War and the trend after the collapse of the Soviet Union - later converged, continuing in similar fluctuations
to this day. The number of women of reproductive age has gone down 30 percent. We need more girls, young
women.

What are we doing to improve the situation? An entire programme was developed. We address this matter
continuously, improving the available instruments. Once again, it works differently in different periods of time.

First, there is a benefit for families with children that is quite effective. We pay this benefit from the moment a
woman becomes pregnant and until the child reaches 18. This benefit is now available to over 10 million children
and around 320,000 pregnant women.

Second, we invented a unique tool that no other country offers - maternity capital that we continue to replenish.

Next, family mortgage rates with 6 percent interest are still available. I suppose we will talk more about mortgages
and construction later. In essence, family mortgage is still available.

We pay 450,000 rubles to families who have a third child, specifically to pay their mortgages.

We are developing the system that encompasses healthcare, childhood and maternity, and we will continue to do
everything and improve these instruments further. These matters are very important.

I want to take this opportunity and address the heads of all Russian regions: this is what your working day should
begin with and end with because it is a challenge for many countries, Russia included. The population is what
makes a country. One territory is good, but it must be populated by the citizens of this country.

Perhaps we are doing a lot, but it is perfectly clear that these measures are not enough. We will be able to say that
yes, we are doing something useful when we can overturn this trend and achieve the indicators I mentioned earlier.

Alexandra Suvorova: In fact, we have received many messages on this subject, including from large families. We
have a whole selection of those.

The problem is as follows. You have mentioned the uniform allowance, but when the average per capita income in
a family exceeds the regional subsistence minimum, the family does not qualify for the benefit. However, in many
cases, this is due to a long streak of inaccuracies, or that income is literally just a few kopecks or rubles above the
required level, but they fail to qualify anyway.

Now we are about to be joined by Anna Shenkao from Surgut, the mother of five.

Ms Shenkao, good afternoon. Please ask the President your question.

Anna Shenkao: Good afternoon, Mr President.

My name is Anna Shenkao. I was born and live in Surgut, Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Area, and I am a mother of
five. One of my children also has a disability.

I have been applying for the relevant benefits every month since July 2023, but all my applications have been
turned down because our per capita income exceeds the regional minimum subsistence level. In some cases, it
was only 78 rubles above that level, but I was rejected anyway.

This is what I would like to ask. Is a child's disability pension considered to be family income? Why are they
counting the previous year's income? And there is something else: my husband is officially employed, which implies

                                                                                                        Page 26 of 62
                             

full compliance with the tax laws. However, when they evaluate the per capita income, they use his gross pay,
including tax, which the employer in fact deducts. We do not receive this money, so I would like to ask why it should
be considered part of our income.

And, if you do not mind, I have one more question - about holidays.

How can a large family - or not necessarily a large family - afford a holiday in this situation? We really want to go
somewhere, but when we analysed airfares a few days ago, most of them hovered around 140,000
&#195;&#162;?'150,000 rubles one way.

I would really like to hear an answer to my question.

Thank you.

Vladimir Putin: Ms Shenkao, you said that you have five children, didn't you?

Anna Shenkao: Yes.

Vladimir Putin: I congratulate you on this. This alone makes you a happy person.

Anna Shenkao: Thank you.

Vladimir Putin: I am sure of that. I want our viewers and listeners to join me in celebrating your family, and follow
your example, first of all.

Secondly, this is the usual formula for evaluating someone's income. They take into account everything, and they
do use the previous year's figures. I cited evaluating economic growth as an example - in any case, it is
recalculated only the following year. Therefore, they consider the previous year's income.

Certainly, we can deliberate on this matter. I will ask Ms Tatyana Golikova and the Ministry of Labour and Social
Protection to examine the issue. However, that is not the most important point - what truly matters is that the issue
you mentioned might arise for other reasons, namely a small excess of income over the threshold at which
payments under the flat-rate allowance are still provided. That is purely a procedural approach.

We have given a lot of thought to how we can avert the situation that you and your family are experiencing. In
principle, the decision has already been reached - we should recalculate personal income tax and subsequently
refund at least seven percent of the tax your family has paid.

We will see how this unfolds. Hopefully, it will offset your loss from not receiving the respective money under the
allowance you mentioned. We will see how it all pans out.

The Government's assumption was that this measure would reimburse you the amount that was underpaid as part
of the allowance you receive. That decision was made recently. I reiterate my hope that this issue will be resolved.
That is the first point.

Secondly, with regard to holidays and travel, you are right - such a problem does exist. I have already spoken to the
relevant executives on this matter.

By the way, our air transportation industry is operating steadily and quite successfully. Last year, they carried, I
believe, 105 million passengers, and this year they are set to transport 111 million passengers. What is going on
there?

There is a provision - it is stated in the code - that multi-child families, families with children, are entitled to a 50
percent discount, I think, on fares. This applies to the standard fare.

                                                                                                       Page 27 of 62
                             

What do the airline companies do? They introduce their own discounts - minor, insignificant, but these are not
standard fares. Then they claim, "We have a discounted fare, we already have a non-standard fare, so we will not
give a 50 percent discount."

This practice must be curtailed. I fully agree with you and urge the Government, together with the airlines, to
address this problem no later than January 14 next year. We will solve this problem.

As for excess income, the refund of seven percent of the personal income tax, we will also observe how it works.

Anna Shenkao: Thank you.

Vladimir Putin: Thank you very much.

Dmitry Peskov: Mr President, I saw there were more questions about demographics.

Vladimir Putin: Go ahead.

Dmitry Peskov: It says here, "Chechnya, important." It is also about demographics.

Vladimir Putin: Yes, please. Where are you?

Ruzana Veselayeva: Vainakh State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company, Chechen Republic.

Mr President, you often emphasise the importance of demographic growth and have used the Chechen Republic as
an example in this regard.

Vladimir Putin: Yes.

Ruzana Veselayeva: Perhaps, it is worth launching a dedicated programme?

Vladimir Putin: I have mentioned the Chechen Republic and Tuva. In Chechnya and Tuva, demographics are
good.

Ruzana Veselayeva: But would it not make sense to introduce a separate programme for regions that are most
efficient in this area?

If I may, a second question. Last year, you approved the high-speed railway strategy, which includes three stages.
One of them - the third stage - covers the Moscow-Adler route.

According to most experts, including Grozny and Makhachkala in the Moscow-Adler Railway would make the
project more cost-effective and efficient. What is your opinion on this? Do you see it as a practicable solution?

Thank you.

Vladimir Putin: Thank you for the question.

You mentioned that demographics are in good shape in Chechnya.

Please take a seat.

Yes, demographics are indeed in good shape in Chechnya and Tuva. These are two federal constituent entities
where the demographic situation is favourable.

In this regard, are additional measures needed? I would say we should simply say thank you, provide support, and
encourage others to follow your example.

For regions where the birth rate is below the fertility rate of 1.41, there is a clear need for a dedicated programme to
support them.

                                                                                                         Page 28 of 62
                              

This is precisely what we are planning to do for these regions. There are about 35 of such regions, if memory
serves. A separate support programme is being developed for these areas, with a funding of 75 billion rubles over
the next few years. That is what we are going to do.

Now, regarding the Moscow-Adler-Grozny-Makhachkala railway. We have several questions in this regard. First, we
need to ensure traffic along the Black Sea coast, provide proper access to Sochi, and eliminate traffic jams that
tend to snarl traffic near Adler, especially during the tourist season. The congestions often leaves people stuck for
hours.

This situation arose because, during preparations for the Olympic Games, a bypass road for Sochi was built, which
created a bottleneck. It is, in fact, an old road that was slightly renovated, but two traffic flows - the old traffic flow
and the Greater Sochi bypass flow - are merging there, creating a single congested access to Adler. This bottleneck
needs to be broken up to make sure vehicles are not stuck in traffic. By the way, Chechen construction companies
will be involved in this work near Adler, though I am not sure about the details.

With regard to Grozny-Makhachkala, this is also an important consideration which should be addressed in the
future. It is a good idea.

Not to hurt anyone's feelings, let's take "Chechnya. Magistry" (masters). Did you want to say the same thing or not?

Khamzat Batukayev: Khamzat Batukayev, Grozny Chechen State Television and Radio Company.

My colleague has already asked the question we had for you and you answered it. Thank you very much. However,
when you were talking to my colleague from Tatarstan, you shared the way you view Kazan.

By the way, I was also at the BRICS Summit. And this reminded me that you had visited the Chechen Republic not
that long ago. So I am asking you: Is Grozny a beautiful city?

Vladimir Putin: It is great. You know, it is a miracle, a present-day miracle for Russia.

You know, I flew over Grozny during the harsh years when we were still fighting terrorists there, primarily
international terrorist groups. The city was one big ruin, and you could hear machine gun rounds targeting the
helicopter from these ruins.

At the time, there were quite a few people in Chechnya who talked about moving the capital to Gudermes.
However, both the first President of the Chechen Republic, and the incumbent President spoke out against these
proposals arguing that Grozny had established itself as Chechnya's historical capital, a capital of the Chechen
people, and that it would be rebuilt at whatever cost.

What has been achieved in Grozny over the past two years is a true miracle. Of course, credit for these
achievements primarily goes to the current President of the Republic. Even more importantly, this is something the
people of Chechnya achieved together. Their hard-working nature and their talent played an instrumental role. I am
not even talking about the mosque. What a beauty! And look at all these new buildings and architectural solutions.
We cannot fail to feel pride for what has been achieved in Chechnya and in Grozny over the recent years.

I would like to commend and congratulate you on these achievements.

Khamzat Batukayev: Mr President, I remember what you said during your visit to the mosque when you were
talking to Chechnya's mufti. You made an important point when you said that in terms of their spiritual and moral
principles, Islam, the Orthodox faith, and all the traditional religions in general, share a common denominator and
foundation.

I would like to ask you about the Russian Special Forces University. You have visited this institution. It has recently
been given your name, to honour you as the Supreme Commander-in-Chief. What do you think about this training
centre? Should it be expanded? Could you share your vision or your assessment? What do you think about it?

                                                                                                         Page 29 of 62
                              

Vladimir Putin: It is great. We really need it. The National Guard has been using it all the time. After all, it trains not
only people from Chechnya, but from across the country.

When I talk to some fighters who are currently fighting in the combat zone and who do not come from Chechnya, I
ask them: "Where are you from?" And they tell me that they got their training at this centre. This centre plays an
important role in enhancing our national defence capabilities.

Thank you.

Dmitry Peskov: Let us take a couple of more questions from the audience. I see our Chinese friends from Xinhua,
the sector right in front of me.

Huang He: Mr President, good afternoon. My name is Huang He, and I represent the Xinhua News Agency of
China. I am delighted to pose a question to you today. I have just two questions.

The first question is this: How do you evaluate the current state of China-Russia relations? Please share with us the
main outcomes of cooperation between our two countries.

The second question: Next year, China and Russia will jointly celebrate the 80th anniversary of Victory in the
Second World War and the 80th anniversary of the founding of the United Nations Organisation. In your view, what
role do the interaction and coordination between China and Russia play in upholding global strategic stability and
international justice?

Thank you very much.

Vladimir Putin: We often discuss cooperation between Russia and the People's Republic of China. Next year, we
will celebrate 75 years of diplomatic relations between our countries. A great deal has transpired in our relations
over these years, but in the past decade, the level and quality of our relations have reached unprecedented heights
in our history.

I will address the economic aspect now, but first and foremost, it is about mutual trust. Everything we do in relation
to each other and how we do it is based on absolute trust to policies of both sides. We engage in nothing that
contradicts our interests, and we do much that benefits both the Chinese people and the peoples of the Russian
Federation.

I have already mentioned the economy: according to various estimates, it stands at US$220-230 billion, and
according to Chinese statistics, up to $240 billion in dollar terms. The trade turnover is impressive. Over the past
year, despite such a solid foundation, growth continues. It is moderate, with an expected three percent increase, but
growth is present. That is the first part.

The second part concerns investment. We have nearly 600 joint investment projects amounting to US$200 billion.
What does this indicate? It suggests that the future is secure.

Lastly, a very significant component, in my opinion, is the humanitarian aspect. We regularly hold cross years: the
Year of Culture, the Year of Youth Exchanges, and so forth. This is crucial for the people of both countries. It forms
the basis for developing economic ties and political cooperation.

The most critical aspect is regional cooperation. Regional leaders engage with one another: Maotai and vodka, of
course, play a part there. But everything is in moderation, as far as I understand. This personal vibe is important,
and there are exchanges between students, between higher education institutions, and so on.

Now, regarding the Great Patriotic War.

The Russian Federation and the People's Republic of China are the countries that suffered the most and achieved
victory in the Second World War at the cost of the heaviest losses. We used to say 20, then 25, and now some

                                                                                                       Page 30 of 62
                             

historians estimate 27 million dead. The toll is even higher in China. It is not widely discussed, but in China, it
exceeds 30 million.

What the Japanese militarists did on Chinese soil was horrific, a dreadful ordeal. The Chinese people endured that
trial. We stood together then, and we stand together now, which is the most important factor, I keep emphasising it,
for stability in global affairs.

An instrument of stability, originally created for this purpose, is the United Nations Organisation: Russia and China,
as founders of the Organisation and permanent members of the Security Council.

We very often, almost always, coordinate our actions on the international stage, and this is a very significant
element of international life. We will continue doing so. I extend my very best wishes to the leader of the People's
Republic of China, a man I consider my friend, President Xi Jinping.

Dmitry Peskov: Friends, I kindly remind you to keep your questions brief and to ask one at a time. I see Kuban,
please pass the microphone.

Marina Smirnova: Good afternoon. I am Marina Smirnova, representing the Ogni Kubani newspaper, Kavkazsky
District, Krasnodar Territory.

My question concerns the current discussions about migration issues and potential solutions. The Krasnodar
Territory is large, welcoming, diverse, and strong, but the challenges related to migrants persist. We have tight
restrictions, such as patents that give the right to work only in the construction industry. What is your perspective on
such restrictions? There is a labour shortage in various regions. How does Russia plan to address this issue? What
is your vision for resolving these challenges?

Vladimir Putin: This is a highly sensitive and pressing issue, not just for us, but even more so for Europe. On the
one hand, we face a significant shortage of workers. As I have mentioned before, our unemployment rate is just 2.3
percent, which is effectively negligible. Business leaders and government officials consistently report substantial
shortfalls, particularly in the construction and industrial sectors, with the demand reaching into the hundreds of
thousands. This is an undeniable fact.

What is the solution? First, to reduce reliance on labour migrants, we need to focus on increasing labour
productivity. This involves introducing and utilising technologies that minimise the demand for large numbers of
unskilled workers. By shifting the emphasis toward high-tech sectors, we can achieve desired outcomes without the
need to bring in significant numbers of migrants for unskilled labour. That is the first step.

Second, if the influx of labour migrants is unavoidable, we must collaborate with partner countries, particularly those
in Central Asia, to prepare individuals effectively. This includes expanding a network of Russian-language schools,
promoting the study of Russian, and familiarising prospective workers with our traditions, culture, and legal
requirements. And of course, we need to tighten requirements to migrants that are already in Russia, ensuring that
they respect the communities in which they live and work. This responsibility falls on law enforcement agencies. In
essence, the solution requires a balanced approach, integrating both economic and law enforcement measures.

There were extensive discussions about whether we should establish a separate agency (which we once had) or
keep it within the Interior Ministry.

I believe that today, we need to strengthen this area of work within the Interior Ministry. We should establish a
dedicated and robust division or centre either within the Interior Ministry or under its auspices, which should
comprise representatives from economic departments to ensure that all decisions are made holistically, in close
coordination with other ministries, departments, and regional authorities.

A significant volume of regulation exists and it should primarily be handled at the regional level. However, all of this
should be coordinated from a single centre. As the system matures and gains the necessary competencies, there
may be a need for a separate agency in the future. This agency should incorporate both a law enforcement and an
economic component.

                                                                                                        Page 31 of 62
                             

Certain steps in this direction have already been taken, with the State Duma passing a law that grants the right not
to accept migrant children who do not speak Russian into schools. This makes sense since it is impossible to teach
a child if they do not understand the language. There needs to be separate instruction in Russian for these children,
but who will bear the cost of this additional language training?

We need to ensure that, on the one hand, the people who arrive have equal rights, that they have guaranteed
access to healthcare and social security, but on the other hand, this should not be an additional burden on the local
population in the host region. It is essential that everyone is comfortable.

There are many issues involved. And of course, the Government should pay great attention to this. How could this
be developed? I just said that initially, this could be done within the Interior Ministry, and later, perhaps, if the
situation requires, we will create a separate agency, which will employ both representatives of law enforcement
bodies and economic agencies.

Dmitry Kulko: Mr President, we have been specially monitoring migration issues. This is indeed a very sensitive and
complex problem.

A significant part of these questions has come from people who come to our country and not always in search of
employment. Many of them are Russian-speakers who wish to return to their homeland, obtain a Russian passport,
and become full-fledged citizens of the Russian Federation. We have received such requests from a range of
countries, including the CIS and Ukraine - as you said today, there are many Russians there.

We have also received such questions from Germany. For example, we were contacted by Leo Seibel, our
compatriot, who left for Germany in 1990 and returned in 2006. He currently resides in Tarusa [Kaluga Region], and
says that, although he has a residence permit, he has not been able to obtain Russian citizenship for years, with the
authorities always giving him the same answer: you are not entitled, there is no such law. A verbatim quote: only
Putin can give you citizenship.

Here is a small detail though. After he told the officials that he had written a letter to Putin, their tone changed, and
they gave him a list of documents he needed to bring. The process seemed to have got off the ground, but he
would like to bring it to its logical end.

Vladimir Putin: Look, Russian citizenship is indeed granted by Presidential executive orders. But this is a purely
formal act that must be prepared locally, by relevant agencies, commissions and committees.

The issue you just raised is part of what we call working with compatriots, meaning individuals who feel that they
belong to Russia. They speak Russian, they consider themselves part of our culture, part of the Russian world, and
as a rule, they are also highly qualified specialists. We are truly interested in attracting such professionals to
Russia; we would like them to work and live here. We actually have a state programme for this. Well, apparently, it
is not working as effectively as it should. Clearly, we need to improve these mechanisms.

You mentioned Ukrainians. It is quite possible that there are as many Ukrainians already living in Russia as in
Ukraine; maybe even more. I am not kidding - this is quite possible, I mean, if we take into account the people living
in our new territories, Crimea as well as those who have moved to Russia, there are millions of people. This
suggests we have about the same number of Ukrainians living here as in Ukraine now. Speaking of which, they are
welcome in Russia, the door is open to them. These people are part of our culture; they are part of our nation.

As I said, these mechanisms certainly need to be improved. We are interested in qualified workforce, including
people who simply - well, not "simply," as this is not a simple thing at all - who uphold our traditional values. This is
difficult to assess. We need to work on this to be able to do this effectively. We will certainly continue doing this.

As for the specific case you mentioned - please send me this person's details, will you? We will definitely help him.

Dmitry Kulko: Thank you.

                                                                                                        Page 32 of 62
                             

Alexandra Suvorova: At the very beginning of the programme we told you that we also used artificial intelligence in
our work. GigaChat helped us select most frequent topics in the queries.

Among the top queries, of course, is housing and mortgages. You also said at the beginning of the programme that
we are going to revisit this issue more than once. If we look at our monitors now, we will see that this topic is at the
top of the list. Actually, the number of queries is also significant.

Let us now bring up a video question from a young family from

Krasnodar.

Question: For three months we've been trying to take out a family mortgage. The banks are constantly running out
of limits, or they increase the down payment from 20 to 50 percent.

Please, tell us how things will be with the family mortgage in general because at present it is very difficult to get it.
Also, in addition to the family mortgage, it is next to impossible to get a rural and IT mortgage. That is, banks are
constantly running out of limits, plus they do not want to approve it. They keep changing mortgage plans every day,
when you apply.

Banks have recently introduced a so-called "combo-mortgage" plan, when they add their interest, and the mortgage
rate goes up from six to 13 percent. In other words, banks simply do not want to issue mortgages for families. What
are we to do?

Vladimir Putin: Thank you for this question and for highlighting this problem. This is an outrage, first of all, because
there should be no limits, and the Government and I have already discussed this topic. I was promised - and I will
check how well this promise is being fulfilled - that there will be no limits.

Because at the end of the day, this is all about subsidies from the state. Banks should enjoy receiving six percent
from those who use family mortgage loans, while the difference between the bank rate and this six percent should
be reimbursed by the state. And there should be no limits on the part of the state.

This difference ends up in banks, by the way, it is income for them, and not a small one. So if they refuse to
approve a family mortgage, it means that the Government does not send this subsidy to the bank in time, probably.
I will check, I promise you, I will definitely check. But we have agreed that there will be no limits. This is the first
point.

Second, this refers to family mortgages at three percent and to rural mortgages. Family mortgages are issued at six
percent, rural mortgages at three percent. This is a very important tool in housing construction. Why? Because of
the total volume of housing built - which last year was 110 million square metres, a record high since the Soviet
Union, nothing like this had ever happened before - 50 percent were private houses, mostly in rural areas.
Moreover, such mortgages are taken out by people under 40 or a little older, they move to rural areas, live there,
take out mortgages, and build families. This mortgage plan should not have any limits either. It amounts to a few
tens of billions for the budget, which is absolutely uncritical, and it should be preserved.

The same goes for IT mortgages. How much do we have? Six or five percent. In any case, it is a preferential
mortgage, and there are not that many people who take it out. We discussed it just recently, and someone
suggested that it should be terminated but there is little sense in doing it so as to save budget funds.

Family mortgages are definitely staying, and rural mortgages are definitely staying. I ask the Government to provide
the necessary subsidies. We will put things in order here.

Alexandra Suvorova: This also refers to Far Eastern regions and new regions.

Vladimir Putin: Far Eastern mortgages at two percent are staying, so do the Arctic mortgages - two percent, and
the new regions - two percent.

                                                                                                       Page 33 of 62
                             

Dmitry Kulko: Mr President, I suggest we now address an issue that, unfortunately, remains pressing year after year
- the problem of phone scammers.

We warn people daily about this on television.

Vladimir Putin: By the way, sorry to interrupt, 110 million square metres of housing were built last year. This year,
it will be slightly less - around 105 million - but that is still a very good figure.

Dmitry Kulko: Phone scammers. The severity of this problem can be understood from just one number: 250 billion
rubles -that is how much scammers stole from Russians this year, according to Sberbank estimates.

These miscreants call and say all sorts of things: they claim to represent the Central Bank or the Federal Security
Service (FSB), warn that deposits in all banks will be frozen, and demand that people transfer money to other
accounts, or even take out loans. Yelena Markelova from Kazan found herself in such a situation. Let us watch her
video appeal now.

Yelena Markelova: Good afternoon, Mr President.

My name is Yelena Markelova. I am a pensioner from Kazan, 63 years old.

Recently, I fell for a scam. My account on Gosuslugi (public services) portal was hacked, and as a result of their
actions, I now owe two banks 1.9 million rubles.

My appeal is a cry for help. How is it possible that the banks, where I am a client and receive a pension of 18,770
rubles, approve such loans without requesting any income documents, without asking for any of my contacts who
could act as a guarantor for me, and for such large amounts with monthly payments that exceed my monthly
income?

Given the large number of pensioners being targeted by scammers, is it not time to take more serious measures
and require banks to more thoroughly monitor the actions of their employees and rigorously verify applications,
especially from elderly people?

Thank you.

Vladimir Putin: Yes, you are right. What is your name?

Dmitry Kulko: Yelena Markelova.

Vladimir Putin: Ms Markelova, you are absolutely right.

There is not much I can add to what you said. Indeed, banks have become adept at issuing loans quickly -
practically instantly - but they must assess the borrower's solvency. There is even a specific rule stating that if more
than 50 percent of a citizen's income goes toward servicing a loan, issuing such a loan becomes more costly for the
bank, and the burden on the bank's capital increases. This rule comes from the Central Bank. However, what is
happening now is deeply concerning, because the scale of this fraud is off the charts.

At a recent Sberbank event, German Gref briefed me on this issue. He explained that across the entire banking
system, scammers from the territory of Ukraine alone, where fraudulent activity has essentially been elevated to the
level of state policy, where entire centres operating under the control of special services are dedicated to swindling
money from Russian citizens, have stolen over 250 billion rubles from our citizens' accounts.

Of course, these practices have reached a substantial scale. In fact, Nazi Germany acted in a similar fashion by
printing banknotes of our World War II allies, including the UK. They printed pound sterling notes and placed them
into circulation in order to undermine the British economy.

                                                                                                       Page 34 of 62
                             

We are witnessing a similar trend in present-day Ukraine as far as these fraudulent practices are concerned. Of
course, we need to make sure that there is discipline in this sector, so this is something that deserves our serious
attention.

For example, let them grant loans under 50,000 rubles, and let them do this online and instantly. As for the loans
between 50,000 and 200,000 rubles, people definitely need at least several hours to carry out additional checks
and take a final decision. As for the loans exceeding 200,000 rubles, this process must definitely take at least
several days.

I know that both the State Duma and the Central Bank have been discussing these matters and are committed to
further improving the decisions dealing with the capital burden with respect to the banks granting unsecured loans
of this kind. I hope that these efforts will enable us to achieve the desired outcomes.

There is another problem, as reported by both the Central Bank Governor and the Interior Ministry. Credit cards are
opened for people who are not taking part in this fraud, or so it seems. The scammers get money out of their victims
by first transferring it to the so-called intermediary cards, and then take hold of the money from these cards.

Meanwhile, those who open these credit cards pretend that they are not involved in any way. There is a proposal to
strengthen controls in this regard and to tighten liability for these people, since they are accomplices in these crimes
and are taking part in these scams. They may not be doing anything from a formal point of view, but they know why
someone is opening a credit card in their name.

The proposal consists of making this a criminal offence. I am not saying that this decision is approved, but we will
definitely have to move in this direction.

Alexandra Suvorova: Do you know anyone who has suffered from phone scams?

Vladimir Putin: I do not know anyone in my entourage who suffered from these practices, but there are certainly
those who told me that they got calls from scammers.

Alexandra Suvorova: It seems that these phone calls will keep coming.

Vladimir Putin: Maybe so, but as soon as they hear an unfamiliar voice making any kind of proposals to them
dealing with doing anything along these lines, they hang up immediately.

And this would be my advice for all people of Russia.

Dmitry Kulko: Quite often, these unfamiliar voices come from call centres in Ukraine. There were reports that the
number of phone calls from scammers declines whenever the Ukrainian energy system suffers a strike. It seems
that these call centres simply lose their power supply.

Vladimir Putin: They do not have enough electric power capacity.

Dmitry Kulko: What about adding these call centres to the list of our priority targets?

Vladimir Putin: No. The priority targets include military sites and defence industry manufacturing facilities. The list
can also include decision-making centres. As for these call centres, we will not waste our munitions on them. There
is no reason for doing so. We must take the necessary measures here in Russia and to work through the relevant
institutions, including the Central Bank and the federal Government, as well as the Interior Ministry's departments.

Alexandra Suvorova: Dmitry, Mr Peskov seems to be casting rather unfriendly glances our way.

Dmitry Peskov: Let's shift our focus back to the audience for a moment.

Ukraine has been mentioned. I see the sign "Other Ukraine."

Galina Merkulova: Mr President,

                                                                                                       Page 35 of 62
                             

My name is Galina Merkulova, I am a deputy head of media resources for Other Ukraine, an international public
movement that represents the interests of millions of Ukrainian citizens both within Ukraine, regrettably still under
the control of the Kiev regime, and in Russia, Europe, and across the globe, where we have 55 offices in operation.

The Other Ukraine public movement believes that the sole means of rescuing Ukrainians from Zelensky's criminal
illegitimate regime, which has usurped the executive, legislative, and judicial powers, is through the reunification of
the Ukrainian and Russian peoples.

Now, here is our question: under what conditions are you prepared to commence negotiations with Kiev? If not with
Zelensky, then with whom?

Additionally, one more crucial aspect: in Ukraine, the Russian Orthodox Church is not merely under attack; it is
virtually expelled. What is your stance on this matter, and do you believe that the position of the Russian Orthodox
Church has been undermined?

Thank you.

Vladimir Putin: Indeed. Firstly, regarding the illegitimacy of the regime, I have previously addressed this issue. I
understand that the leader, the mastermind behind this movement, this organisation... Is it the Other Ukraine
organisation?

Galina Merkulova: It's a movement.

Vladimir Putin: Yes, it is, apparently, Viktor Medvedchuk, isn't it?

We rarely see each other, but I am aware that he shares this view. So, what constitutes the illegitimacy of the
regime? Allow me to reiterate: there is no provision in the Constitution of Ukraine to extend the powers of the
President, even under martial law. There is only one representative body of power, the Council, or the Rada, whose
powers can be extended without elections under martial law. I repeat, this is the Rada.

What is the challenge for Ukraine? I understand that you are cognisant of this: the state system in Ukraine is
structured in such a way that a plethora of government bodies are appointed by the president. This includes
regional governors, leadership of all law enforcement agencies, and so forth. However, if the head of state is
illegitimate, then everything else loses its legitimacy in terms of executive bodies and law enforcement agencies.
And everything they do, following his instructions, makes them aware that they are complicit in this unlawful activity.
This is the first point.

Now, regarding the conditions for starting negotiations: We have no preconditions. We are ready to engage in
dialogue without any preconditions. However, as I have mentioned numerous times before, based on the
agreements that we reached during the negotiation process in Istanbul at the end of 2022 and proceeding from the
current realities on the ground.

Our positions were clearly outlined, including in my June speech to the leadership of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
of the Russian Federation. Everything that needs to be said is already there. There is no point in repeating.

If the head of the regime is illegitimate, then with whom? You know, if someone were to go through elections and
gain legitimacy, we would talk with anyone, including Zelensky.

If Ukraine truly wants a peaceful settlement, they have the ability to organise this process within their country as
they see fit. We can only sign agreements with those who hold legitimate authority, such as the Verkhovna Rada
and its Chair, who are fully subordinate to the head of the regime. This is simply a formal legal matter.

They can organise it as they see fit within their country. But if we ever get to the point of signing a document, it can
only be done with the representatives of legitimate authorities, that is the bottom line.

Alexandra Suvorova: There was also a question about the Russian Orthodox Church.

                                                                                                     Page 36 of 62
                            

Vladimir Putin: You know, what is happening with regard to the Russian Orthodox Church in Ukraine is a unique
situation. This is a gross, blatant violation of human rights, the rights of believers. The church is being torn apart
right before everyone's eyes. This is like execution by firing squad, and yet the world seems to ignore it.

I think those who engage in such actions will get it back. You mentioned that they are tearing things apart, and that
is exactly what is happening. These people are not even atheists. Atheists are individuals who believe in the idea
that there is no God, but this is their faith, their convictions and worldview.

But these are not atheists; they are people without any faith at all. They are ethnic Jews, but who has ever seen
them in a synagogue? They are not Orthodox Christians either, since they do not attend churches. And they
certainly are not followers of Islam, as they are unlikely to be seen in a mosque.

These are individuals without kith or kin. They do not care about anything that is dear to us and the overwhelming
majority of the Ukrainian people. Eventually, they will run away someday and go to the beach rather than to church.
But that is their choice.

I believe that someday the people in Ukraine, and the majority of Ukrainians are still connected to Orthodoxy, will
evaluate their actions accordingly.

Dmitry Peskov: Let us take a couple more questions from the audience. I would be remiss not to give Radio Purga
a chance to ask a question.

Anastasia Lavrentyeva: Good afternoon.

Radio Purga, Chukotka Autonomous Area. My name is Anastasia Lavrentyeva. Thank you very much for this
opportunity.

I am looking at the monitors showing the relevance of topics for various regions, and I see confirmation that my
question is indeed important and concerns many residents of our region. It is about connectivity and internet
access.

Mr President, in Chukotka, high-speed internet is available only in the regional capital, the only city. All other
residents of the region are deprived of the benefits and opportunities the internet has to offer. Beyond
entertainment, essential services like the Gosuslugi portal, banking services for the business are inaccessible to
most of Chukotka residents. Could you help address this issue of digital inequality, if possible?

Vladimir Putin: Yes, there is no need for lengthy discussion, because we already have a programme for
developing internet connectivity, including high-speed internet, as well as communication infrastructure in general.
This involves satellite constellations, particularly those focused on communication systems.

All of this will certainly be implemented. I will not go into the details since they are widely known and publicly
available. We are working in this direction, with corresponding resources allocated and plans in place. There will be
no disruptions, and we will proceed according to the plan.

I very much hope that residents of remote regions too, including Chukotka, will fully enjoy the benefits of modern
civilisation. For a country like ours, this is extremely important, as more and more people work remotely and receive
education online. High-speed internet is critical in this regard. We will undoubtedly achieve this. There is no doubt
about it.

Dmitry Peskov: Alexander is one of the patriarchs of Russian journalism. Please.

Alexander Gamov: Thank you very much.

Komsomolskaya Pravda website, radio, and newspaper. And "Putin's team." I am sitting here today with young
ladies, Yulia and Marina, who welcomed me into their group.

                                                                                                        Page 37 of 62
                             

This has not been mentioned yet, but I would like to congratulate all of us, and you, Mr President, because, by my
estimates, today marks the 20th news conference, even though some colleagues argue that it is the 21st
conference. There is no other format like this elsewhere in the world, and I hope it continues for as long as
possible.

Now, my question. Contrary to sceptics' predictions, the presidential programme "The Time of Heroes" has not
become a fleeting project or a mere formality. It is working. What hopes did you personally have for it? Have they
been realised? What hopes do you have for it now?

In the past few days and hours, a question has increasingly occupied my mind: why do we not adequately care for
and protect our heroes? I am speaking not only about the death of General Kirillov, which was briefly mentioned
here today, but also about numerous instances where participants in the special military operation have been
insulted. Fortunately, law enforcement agencies have been vigilant, and justice has prevailed, as was extensively
reported.

As concerns the Time of Heroes programme. I represent the heroic newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda, which
served as a frontline publication during the Great Patriotic War and continues to do so today. Our war
correspondents work with courage, and since 2014, we have been publishing KP in Donetsk, Donbass.

Next year, we will be celebrating our 100th anniversary on May 24, 2025. My colleagues have asked me to extend
an invitation to you. Mikhail Petrov shared with us how the TASS agency commemorated its 120th anniversary with
great ceremony and was honoured with an order. We look forward to welcoming you on May 24 at about noon. Will
you attend, Mr President?

Vladimir Putin: I will make every effort to be there.

Alexander Gamov: Thank you.

Vladimir Putin: Thank you very much for the invitation. The Komsomolka newspaper has been an integral part of
the lives of many generations of our citizens. People would begin their day with it and continue to rely on it
throughout the day. The newspaper is evolving into a modern media platform, operating across all information
environments. It remains a stable, reliable, and objective media outlet. I would like to congratulate you on the
success of your work and express my gratitude for the invitation.

Regarding the Time of Heroes platform, I have previously mentioned that the idea occurred to me after meeting in
St Petersburg with young participants, mainly students, involved in the special military operation. Observing them, I
thought: here they are - the future of our country, the future workforce. This is how the concept for such a platform
was conceived. I will not conceal that after returning to Moscow and presenting the idea, I requested my colleagues
in the Executive Office to bring it to fruition. They are the ones who came up with the name The Time of Heroes,
which I believe is an excellent choice.

The first round attracted 43,000 applications. Naturally, the selection process is quite rigorous: we chose only 83
individuals from these 43,000. And understandably so, as we require individuals with experience in administrative
work, those who are educated and meet the criteria necessary for future roles as leaders of major companies,
municipalities, entire regions, ministries and agencies, among others.

I stated this at the United Russia party congress, and I would like to reiterate it now: certainly, all are worthy - every
one of our men and women fighting for their Motherland, risking their lives and health, is deserving. However, there
is the matter of their suitability for the professional path they aspire to pursue. Once again, education and
experience are prerequisites.

In general, it is one thing to fight for the Motherland and quite another to work with people. You must possess a
certain talent and aptitude for it, you know? These are distinct types of activities. We must select the right
individuals from this group who are both willing and able to excel in these areas. Thus far, there have been no
missteps: they are truly outstanding individuals.

                                                                                                        Page 38 of 62
                             

The second enrolment campaign is currently underway, and the number of applications has already exceeded
15,000. It will continue next year until mid-January or February, I think. This is to say that this effort is gathering
pace.

As for the first class, its participants continue their training, even though many of them have already received offers,
and quite a few are already working in new positions. Some of them went as far as become heads of regions. This
genuinely makes me happy. Some are working in the private sector, while others have taken up jobs in government
institutions and administrations at all levels, including regional, local and federal agencies, as well as major
corporations.

I would like to reiterate what I said at the United Russia congress. During my recent visit to a rehabilitation centre, I
met with young men who had suffered severe wounds. Some had lost a leg, or an arm. But here is what I wanted to
tell you: there was fire in their eyes. They want and are ready to work and to make a difference. And they have
everything it takes to succeed. Thanks to the latest rehabilitation methods - I am talking about the most advanced
and recently developed treatments - they can do anything without any health restrictions or limitations. All we need
to do is help them get there.

Let me reiterate that one of these men - I remember his face - told me: "I understand that I need an education and
experience, but I do not have either an education or any experience; still, I want to do it." These are the kind of
people we need. We need people who want to work. All we need to do is help them. We must find them and
support them.

You know, it just occurred to me that when I applied to join a judo club, our coach, Anatoly Rakhlin, told us: go
ahead and do as many pull-ups as you can. For some reason, several of those who did more pull-ups than I did
were not accepted. Several years later, we asked him: Mr Rakhlin, how come you refused to accept these young
men, but decided to take us on board despite the fact that we could not do as many pull-ups? You know what his
answer was? He was a wise man, you know. He said, this is because you put in all the effort you had until your
arms were shaking, but you still kept trying to reach the bar with your chin, while those who did more pull-ups than
you, they did it without any stress, and they could have done more, but they did not put in all the effort they had and
did not give it their all.

These men have given all they have, they are willing to go the whole nine yards, and we must help them. They
need our support.

Alexander Gamov: There was also a question about protecting our heroes.

Vladimir Putin: This is a very important question, indeed. You are right.

What can I say? First, this has happened before, and we have already seen these attempts and understand what
our adversary is after. Unfortunately, this was not a standalone, isolated assassination attempt. In fact, people
outside the military have also been targeted. I have already told your American colleague that there have been
assassination attempts against journalists and public figures before. Do you remember how Dugina lost her life?

What does it mean? This demonstrates the Kiev regime's terrorist nature. At the same time, of course, it indicates
that our competent law enforcement agencies and intelligence services failed to prevent these attacks and allowed
these blows to reach their targets. What can I say in this regard? We must further improve their work and prevent
these failures, which come at such a huge cost to us. That is all there is to it.

Alexander Gamov: Thank you.

Dmitry Peskov: You know, I have caught sight of a very popular young blogger. He is getting up.

Vlad Bumaga: Mr President, good afternoon.

My name is Vlad Bumaga, and I am a popular video blogger. I have over 80 million subscribers on social networks,
mostly young people.

                                                                                                        Page 39 of 62
                             

As we know, young people spend a lot of time online - an average of five to eight hours per day, with half of that
time devoted to watching video content. For my part, like many other creators, I am actively involved in developing
our Russian platforms, such as VK Video. Of course, these platforms are not yet very large, but they demonstrate
good and confident growth and provide high-quality services.

My question in this connection is this: why block YouTube if our platforms are coping well as they are? They are
competitive and offer excellent terms and alternatives for creators? Moreover, we can upload content there and
transmit our ideas and messages to audiences that extend beyond the Russian-speaking community.

There is another important issue. As I mentioned before, practically all children in this country know and watch me. I
will add that I became a father myself earlier this year.

Vladimir Putin: My congratulations!

Vlad Bumaga: Thank you.

Vladimir Putin: Please congratulate your wife on my behalf, it is her due.

Vlad Bumaga: I will do so without fail.

I would like to ask what values I, as a person whose videos nurture an entire generation, should communicate to
the audience. Or, perhaps, what messages I should not communicate to the audience. What is your personal
opinion on the ideas and messages that should be prioritised when it comes to young people? Give us a direction,
so to speak. We will take note and start working.

Thank you.

Vladimir Putin: First, regarding the YouTube slowdown. Here, there are more questions for YouTube than for us.

Sorry, let me first ask whether Vlad Bumaga is your pen-name?

Vlad Bumaga: No, it is my real name.

Vladimir Putin: I see, excellent! Paper (bumaga), in a well-known game, is stronger than stone. Therefore, I
congratulate you: 80 million subscribers, did you say? This is certainly a unique achievement. This means the
content you create meets the expectations of these 80 million people. This is the result of your creative work, and I
congratulate you on that.

As for the slowdown, YouTube is owned by Google. When it started operating in Russia, it created its Russian
subsidiaries, the legal entities on its payroll, as well as the services it should take care of. It worked with the
subsidiaries it had created, but when the West started introducing various restrictions and sanctions, Google
stopped or reduced the financing of these subsidiaries and the provision of the necessary equipment, thereby
creating problems for itself. This is the first point.

Second, YouTube and Google must comply with our laws and avoid dishonest online activities. In other words, they
must not use online resources for promoting their governments' political goals.

Here is what I mean. Suppose you search for some information online, for example regarding culture or music, but
instead, you are offered information that has nothing to do with culture or music but promotes a certain political
platform. They are also removing the names of our artists, bloggers, politicians and the like from their services.

All this amounts to a violation of Russian laws. As a result, Roskomnadzor and other relevant authorities present
their claims, and rightly so. Therefore, the perpetrators face a choice. They can choose to respect our laws, which
would expose them to restrictions in their own country, forcing them to limit their operations to their own territory, or
they can choose to work in Russia, in which case they must respect our laws.

                                                                                                      Page 40 of 62
                             

As for what you have said, nature abhors a vacuum, and competition is growing here with the development of VK,
Telegram and Rutube. If Google and YouTube, being aware of that, change the mode of their operations, they will
have no problems here.

Regarding the subjects that can be used to enhance the awareness of our young people, how this can be done and
what should not be done, I am sure that there is no need for my advice. People like you, especially now that you
have become a father, have a growing sense of responsibility. It is a responsibility to your children, their future and
the country where your children will live. This feeling of responsibility is a better guide than I could ever be about
what would be useful for our children in the future, what is dangerous and unacceptable, and what you should fight
against, not on my instructions but at the call of your heart.

Dmitry Peskov: Thank you.

I believe I have overlooked TV-3; they certainly do not deserve this.

Vladimir Putin: May I interrupt you for a second? We were just talking about children, and I see a young woman
over there with a "Families with children deceived" sign. How were they deceived?

Anna Suvorova: Apparently, this is not about child benefits, because we have already discussed them.

Vladimir Putin: I could have mentioned them. I think I did.

Yelena Usmanova: I can explain.

Good afternoon, Mr President.

Yelena Usmanova, Business Online newspaper from Tatarstan - this is Tatarstan again.

First of all, I would like to thank you on behalf of Kazan for the honour of hosting the BRICS summit, but my
question is about something else, as you can see from the poster.

A group of scammers deceived hundreds of families in Tatarstan who wanted their own homes. Each of them took
out a preferential mortgage for individual housing construction under the state support programme, but the houses
were never built.

Will the authorities help the defrauded borrowers under that programme, as they once helped the unfortunate co-
investors in apartment block projects who were subsequently cheated out of their property? These people continue
to pay mortgages for hot air, while the government continues to transfer state support to banks for houses that were
never even built. When will they start helping people, not banks?

Thank you.

Vladimir Putin: Please, listen to me. It is not about the banks at all. We have created a system of escrow accounts,
where people transfer their money when they take out a mortgage. The money is then frozen in those escrow
accounts until the new owners receive their housing. Where have they transferred the money?

Yelena Usmanova: No, this is about the individual housing construction programme. Houses, not apartments.

Vladimir Putin: There is no difference.

Yelena Usmanova: Apparently, that arrangement was not yet in place at the time.

Vladimir Putin: Individual housing construction qualifies for preferential mortgage programmes. As I said, the
interest is 3 percent in rural areas. Single-family homes account for 50 percent of the 110 million square metres
built in 2023 and 105 million this year. Fifty percent is a breakthrough. But the money should be in escrow accounts.
Where have the people transferred this money and why did they do it, if those were not escrow accounts? I really
do not understand what you are talking about.

                                                                                                        Page 41 of 62
                              

Yelena Usmanova: This is what happened in Tatarstan. Hundreds of families have indeed found themselves in this
predicament.

Vladimir Putin: Can you tell me where they transferred the money?

Yelena Usmanova: I am not sure about the details. I know that they took -

Vladimir Putin: Listen, please, what is your name?

Yelena Usmanova: Yelena.

Vladimir Putin: Yelena, these details matter.

Yelena Usmanova: There were definitely no escrow accounts there.

Vladimir Putin: How could this have happened? This may be another fraudulent scheme, like the ones scammers
use to steal money from people's accounts.

We will need to look into this, because this particular case may give us leads on other possible cases of this kind
and help prevent this kind of fraud.

Right now, I cannot make heads or tails of what you are saying. Please provide us with more information. All right,
Yelena? This is extremely important.

Why? Because the main point here is that we still have numerous unfinished housing projects. However, the total
amount we now have in the escrow accounts is about 7 trillion rubles, or maybe even a little more. This is more
than 65 percent of the amount needed to complete the projects co-financed by the people in 2025. I can almost
guarantee that this housing will be built. And no one will be cheated out of their apartments, because part of the
work is already done. The money is in these accounts; it is protected. If you are referring to cases where no escrow
accounts were used, please provide this information - this needs to be sorted out.

Thank you.

Dmitry Peskov: Yes, we will request this information.

We wanted to give the floor to the TV-3 channel.

Vladimir Putin: I see someone from Turkiye.

Dmitry Peskov: All right, let it be Turkiye then.

Vladimir Putin: Do not worry, we will get back to you.

Ali Cura: My name is Ali Cura, Anadolu news agency.

Mr President, Israel is violating international law, killing tens of thousands of people, including children, in Palestine
and Lebanon. Israel is using the current situation to occupy Syria and is infringing on its sovereignty. What can you
say about Israel's actions? Have you spoken with President Erdogan about the region as a whole? Thank you.

Vladimir Putin: I maintain regular contact with President Erdogan. I do not remember when we last spoke, but we
certainly discussed the situation in the Middle East.

Everyone is aware of President Erdogan and Turkiye's attitude to the developments in the Middle East, as well as
our stance on Lebanon and Palestine. It does not depend on fluctuations. We have always believed, and continue
to do so, that the Palestinian problem can only be settled if the reasons for its existence are eliminated. There is a
well-known UN Security Council decision on the establishment of two states - Israel and Palestine. Israel has been
established, but the state of Palestine has not been created to this day. That is the problem.

                                                                                                        Page 42 of 62
                             

Moreover, Israel continues to implement its illegal settlement policy. I am not aware of Israel's ultimate goal in the
Gaza Strip, but its activities deserve to be censured. We have done this on many occasions and at nearly all levels,
from public venues to putting forth our position at the UN Security Council. There is nothing more to add.

The same goes for our stance on Lebanon.

As for Syria, frankly, I believe that Turkiye is doing everything in its power to ensure its security along the southern
borders in light of the situation in Syria, to create conditions for the movement of refugees from its territory to other
areas, most of which are located in the Turkiye-controlled territories in Syria, and possibly to push the Kurdish
forces from the border. All these goals can and possibly will be achieved, to a certain degree. And yet, I believe that
the main beneficiary of the developments in Syria is Israel.

You may hold any opinion about Israel's actions, but Russia condemns the seizure of Syrian territories. Our position
on this matter is clear and unchanging. At the same time, Israel is addressing its own security concerns. For
instance, in the Golan Heights, Israel has advanced along the front by 62-63 kilometres and to a depth of 20-25
kilometres. They have occupied fortifications originally built for Syria by the Soviet Union, strong defensive
structures comparable to the Maginot Line.

We remain hopeful that Israel will eventually withdraw from Syria. However, at present, it is deploying additional
troops there. It seems there are already several thousand personnel stationed there. It appears not only that they
have no intention of leaving, but they may also be planning to further reinforce their presence.

Moreover, the local population has already expressed a desire to be incorporated into the Jewish state, which could
create further complications down the line. If the ongoing developments ultimately result in the fragmentation of
Syria, these matters will need to be addressed by the local population in line with the United Nations Charter and
the principle of self-determination. It is a complex issue, perhaps best reserved for future discussions.

We are well aware that Turkiye has faced longstanding challenges with the Kurdistan Workers' Party for decades.
While we hope for no further escalation, some European politicians recently remarked in meetings that, after World
War I, the Kurds were promised their own state but were ultimately deceived.

The Kurdish population in the region is substantial, numbering in the tens of millions across Turkiye, Iran, and Iraq,
where they live in concentrated communities. Estimates suggest there are at least 30 to 35 million Kurds. This
underscores the gravity of the Kurdish issue. The Kurds are formidable and resilient, known for their fighting spirit.
For instance, they withdrew from Manbij, but only after putting up fierce resistance.

The Kurdish issue requires a resolution. This should have been addressed within the framework of Syria under
President Assad. Now, it must be resolved with the authorities currently in control of Syrian territory, while Turkiye
must also find a way to ensure its security. We understand the complexity of these matters. However, this is a topic
for another discussion, so as not to take up time today.

I want to emphasise that while challenges remain, our position firmly aligns with international law and the
sovereignty of all nations, including respect for Syria's territorial integrity. This extends to supporting the stance of
the current authorities governing the territory of the Syrian Arab Republic.

In this regard, we stand with them. Furthermore, we maintain communication with these authorities as well as with
all major groups currently exerting control in Syria.

Dmitry Peskov: We've promised to call on a TV-3 war correspondent.

Vladimir Putin: Yes, I am sorry.

Alexander Malkevich: Alexander Malkevich, Itogovaya Programma, TV-3.

A brief message to begin with: our soldiers asked me to thank you. Last week, you met with members of the
Presidential Council for Civil Society and Human Rights and supported their idea of creating a federal museum of

                                                                                                        Page 43 of 62
                             

the special military operation. Preserving historical memory, particularly in creative formats, is our media Oreshnik
in the information war that the West is attempting to wage against us.

The fighters from St Petersburg convey their special thanks for awarding our legendary Leningrad Regiment the
honorific Guards title.

Now, my question is about the Defenders of the Fatherland Foundation. Created in April 2023 by your Executive
Order, it has operated for one and a half years. How do you assess its performance in 2024 on a five-point or ten-
point scale? What main goals have you set for the foundation for next year? What is the chief criterion of its
efficiency, as you see it?

Vladimir Putin: As for the work done by the Defenders of the Fatherland Foundation... I think it was created in
June, not April, but this is unimportant. It started operating in June.

It was established after I had a meeting with mothers and widows of participants in the special military operation. I
realised that the usual methods of support for the soldiers who needed assistance or had been heavily wounded or
handicapped, for the families of our fallen heroes, were not sufficient and it was necessary to create a special
mechanism, a special tool for those, among others, who were losing their connection with the Armed Forces. The
Defenders of the Fatherland Foundation was created precisely for this purpose, to support the men who are leaving
military service and yet require a caring attitude from the state; they need attention that is not formal or superficial
but implies an individual approach to each person in every family. The foundation was created with this objective in
mind.

What is on its agenda? Addressing social issues, processing various allowances and payments on behalf of those
who need prosthetic care or have been registered as disabled, and arranging prosthetics for them.

We must give credit to the foundation: they are doing good work. They not only order an item but provide a
comprehensive service. This includes training the men and selecting a facility that offers prosthetic care. They also
plan for further care, ensuring that it is straightforward and does not require patients to travel across this country for
treatment. Ours is a huge country after all. This problem still exists, but they are working to resolve it. This was their
task.

I spoke to Anna Tsivileva not so long ago. She says the requests are now amended with... Do you know what? I
was quite happy to learn that the men were sending requests for jobs. This is one of the most important areas of
their work, by the way. Increasingly more people are sending requests for engagement in sports and participation in
cultural events. And this is a positive development. You see, this means a trend towards better options; it exists, it
has emerged. And this is very encouraging.

But employment is certainly the most important aspect. I have already mentioned this - they are young men with
shining eyes, and they have received excellent training, something many can only dream of. In today's conditions,
they could certainly continue their service in the Armed Forces - a relevant decision has been made. What I am
saying is that their further careers should not be limited to military enlistment offices, where they are unlikely to earn
much, as they offer a rather modest level of income. They can work in IT, or in medicine. They can work anywhere,
or they could engage in sports - military sports or civilian sports.

There are various ways to achieve fulfilment, and there is a growing number of opportunities, thanks to modern
technologies and with due account of personal preferences. They are working on this, and they are generally doing
very well. You know, no big project is implemented without a hitch. In this case, however, we have many people
working on this who have some connection with the special military operation: the widows of unfortunately fallen
soldiers, the mothers of our fighters who are still there at the frontlines, or just people who care. In this sense, and
perhaps because of this - incidentally, many veterans who have returned from the front are working there, too - this
is probably the key reason the work is going well.

I was reluctant to let the head of the foundation, Anna Tsivileva, go to work for the Defence Ministry, but I finally
consented to Minister Belousov's proposal when he told me that he thought it would be a good idea to build a

                                                                                                       Page 44 of 62
                             

seamless support system, which would encompass those who continue to serve in the Armed Forces, with the
Defence Ministry, those who are still fighting, but need some support measures, as well as those who are now
beyond the scope of the Defence Ministry. I thought we needed someone to do this.

Just recently, last summer, I think, the Defence Ministry created a social centre. So today, this social centre and the
Defenders of the Fatherland Foundation are working as a one-stop shop, which helps people who are part of the
Defence Ministry system and those who are not. This system seamlessly combines both spheres. They are
probably struggling with many problems, but overall, the work is improving.

They have actually participated in decision-making on compensation rules for wounded soldiers. Until now, all
wounded soldiers in our country received 3 million rubles regardless of the severity of their case - a small scratch, a
minor injury, or a serious injury that led to disability - everyone received 3 million. In fact, servicemen themselves
have asked the Ministry of Defence and the Defenders of the Fatherland Foundation to change this system, and we
did. Now the fighters who are seriously injured, receive 4 million.

But when this was reported to me, I immediately saw that the fighters who had been seriously injured and received
disabilities before that, had been paid 3 million. And now, we have started paying four, meaning they have been left
out. So, I had a simple idea: those who had earlier received 3 million, need to be given an additional million
retroactively. This means the government has underpaid them. So, now all of them are receiving an additional
million each, and the payments are being processed quickly.

This work is also organised by the Defenders of the Fatherland Foundation.

Dmitry Kulko: I suggest we return to the concerns of Russian citizens. You've probably seen them.

Vladimir Putin: Excuse me, Ksenia has been raising her hand for a while. Please, Ksenia.

Ksenia Sobchak: Mr President, Ksenia Sobchak, Ostorozhno Media.

You touched on a very important topic regarding the one-stop shop concept and the capabilities of the Ministry of
Defence. I would like to discuss this issue from a different perspective.

Many of us - journalists, celebrities and concerned citizens - are involved in various initiatives. For example, for the
past two years, we have been running a large-scale project to help residents of Belgorod and Kursk regions - our
fellow citizens affected by attacks from the Armed Forces of Ukraine. This year alone, we have managed to help
over 600 families.

I believe there are many other compassionate individuals out there. Would it be possible, in your opinion, to create
a one-stop shop for these civic initiatives as well? This could help integrate public and volunteer efforts with social
workers and existing state structures. Such a platform could function on a voluntary basis but provide a unified
mechanism for coordinating assistance across a wide range of needs.

For example, we often encounter challenges like finding employment in new locations or securing spots in
kindergartens and other institutions for families with children that are temporarily relocating. Could such a one-stop
shop be established to support these civic initiatives?

Vladimir Putin: First, let me thank you for what you are doing. Providing direct assistance to people is extremely
important.

Second, I want to express gratitude to all volunteers. Their work is invaluable, but it also comes with risks. Sadly,
there have even been losses among volunteers. Their efforts often reach individuals more directly and sometimes
reveal where state mechanisms are effective and where they fall short.

As for your suggestion, we do have programmes in place. For instance, there is a recovery programme for the
Kursk Region, with allocated funding that is already practically in place. Similar measures are being implemented in

                                                                                                       Page 45 of 62
                             

other border regions, including Belgorod and Bryansk regions. No one will be left without support. You probably
perceive these needs more acutely, given your involvement.

I will personally consider how this can be organised and will consult with the relevant agencies, including the
Ministry of Defence and regional governors, to explore how these efforts can be coordinated - whether through a
one-stop shop or some other mechanism. We will definitely think it through. Thank you, Ksenia.

I do not have an immediate answer right now, but the question you have raised is absolutely valid, and we will work
on a solution.

Thank you.

Dmitry Kulko: Mr President, I suggest we continue the topic of the special military operation and the support for the
military and their families.

You must have seen that among the inquiries we received for this programme, there were also requests for
assistance with payments and benefits that are supposed to be allocated for the military and their families. There
were also requests for assistance with finding people who are reported missing or with whom there is no contact, or
who, according to their families, are being held captive.

Mr President, is it possible to issue an instruction to the Defence Military specifically to deal with these cases? The
families are struggling without knowing for certain what has happened. Is it possible to improve the notification
system for the families of the military?

Vladimir Putin: It is a very sensitive issue for many.

It is one thing when a person is fighting and, God willing, everything turns out well.

There are different forms of benefits. In general, they are quite decent: there is battle pay, sometimes also called
detached-duty allowance, for those who found themselves in certain regions before the start of the special military
operation and it was considered a tour of duty. There is also pay for participation in offensive and storming
operations, and in organising defence. There is a slight difference, but the grounds for pay are real.

When a person disappears from the radar, the matter of family support arises. We discussed this, and the Defence
Minister is aware of this issue. There are at least two things that need to be done.

First of all, it is necessary to expedite final decisions. When information is lacking, families stop receiving
corresponding benefits because the person is not there; he is not involved in any offensive or defensive operation;
he is not receiving battle pay, and so forth. As a result, the scope of family support diminishes.

Here, the Ministry of Defence and the Government must take a different decision - on what can substitute these
payments at least partly. There are different ideas: to develop a form of child benefit, or find another solution. But a
decision is necessary on temporary measures, and this matter must be resolved promptly. I will not go into details
now. Overall, the Ministry of Defence is aware of this problem and is working on it.

Alexandra Suvorova: Meanwhile, we have been working for more than three hours; almost three hours and ten
minutes.

We have many questions, and they are different. I propose a a quick round of questions. Dmitry, what do you think?
Shall we begin?

Dmitry Kulko: Let's start with a question from Georgy Arefyev from the Smolensk Region: Why do high-ranking
officials have to ask for your instructions at the meetings you hold so that they can start doing something?

Vladimir Putin: There is no need to scold officials.

                                                                                                        Page 46 of 62
                             

Why is that so? The decision-making process is difficult; and when it reaches me, there are this kind of questions
and problems. There are various ways to approach the solution: some of my colleagues believe it should be done
one way, and others think differently. When there is a dispute or a fork, as they say in the Government, as they are
deciding on an issue, then my colleagues come to me asking to make the final decision, as the commander. They
ask for instructions so they won't forget anything; the final decision is turned into instructions, and they get down to
work.

There are many bureaucratic subtleties; sometimes everyone agrees on something, but it must be put on paper and
implemented as a regulation.

Alexandra Suvorova: The next question is: "Who would you like to have a cup of tea with from among currently
living or deceased people?"

Vladimir Putin: Considering the living, I would like to meet with my friends and relatives more often, to have tea
and talk with them.

As for the deceased world leaders, I was in touch with German Chancellor [Helmut] Kohl, though not very
personally, but for a long time.

He was a person of the global scale, and not just because he was a big man but because of his actions and
convictions. He came to visit me right after our first meeting in 1993 and continued to do so for a very long time, not
very often but regularly, even after his term ended. I had the pleasure - let me stress this - to talk to him.

It was a big political figure of that time, as they used to say in the Soviet Union. He did a lot for his country and for
the Germans. He was a major European and global politician.

I vividly recall many of our conversations. They were very useful for me; I am saying this without exaggeration.

President of France [Jacques] Chirac was a very interesting person, too. Just interesting. You know, he was
something of an encyclopedist, or an academic: he knew everything you could ask about. It was curious, honestly.
He had an opinion about everything, and he always stood for it. He was a very tactful and courteous person. I
learned a lot from him, too, to be honest, just as I learned a lot of things from Kohl and made a mental note of them.
I noted this in Chirac too: his behaviour, and his intelligence among other traits.

Berlusconi was slightly different, but also very pleasant to talk to, he was active and very tenacious. Just like Chirac,
he did a lot for the development of Russian-Italian relations. Despite what is happening today, we can feel that that
there is a certain affection for Russia in Italian society, just like we feel affection for Italy.

All of them made a significant contribution to the development of bilateral relations and world politics. Their
company was always interesting. They had strong personalities and their own opinions. It was all focused on
achieving the maximum result for their countries and strengthening the sovereignty of their states.

I still have many friends in Asia. I have already spoken about friendly relations with...

Alexandra Suvorova: With China, as you said.

Vladimir Putin: With China and India. I have very warm relations with the Prime Minister of India. I have many
people I can talk with. However, like any person, I would like to say once again that these are my family and some
friends I have had since childhood, and I treasure that a lot.

Alexandra Suvorova: Next question.

Dmitry Kulko: Mr President, I have something between a question and request for advice from Tatyana Prokhorova
from Chuvashia: "Do you have bank deposits? If so, in which banks?"

                                                                                                         Page 47 of 62
                              

Vladimir Putin: Initially, I had a deposit in Sberbank, I think. Then, when Rossiya Bank was the first financial
institution to be sanctioned, I demonstratively transferred my money there. I think, my salary is also transferred
there.

Alexandra Suvorova: Next question: "Did Elvira Nabiullina tell you what the Central Bank rate will be tomorrow?" I
think this would be interesting not only for Valery Semenov from the Pskov Region, who wrote this question.

Vladimir Putin: No, she does not tell me what the rate will be. Perhaps she does not know this yet, because they
discuss it at the board meeting, their "Komsomol cell," and make the final decision in the course of the discussion. I
hope that it will be balanced and will meet today's requirements.

Dmitry Kulko: Another question: "Vladimir Zhirinovsky's predictions about the developments in the Middle East and
the South Caucasus are coming true. Will other predictions of the LDPR founder come true?"

Vladimir Putin: Of course, I knew Vladimir Zhirinovsky well. He was no fortune teller, but he liked provocations
and had fun shocking others. However, he was an erudite, and a well-prepared one; he was a specialist on the
Middle East. A true expert. Everything he said came true because he relied on his analysis of what was happening
in Russia and the world, and forecast the unfolding of the situation. This really comes true.

However, it was a forecast based on real knowledge and the experience he had as an expert.

Alexandra Suvorova: I propose returning to the blitz a bit later, near the end.

Dmitry Peskov: The blitz can go on forever.

Alexandra Suvorova: Yes, sure, with 2,200 questions.

Dmitry Peskov: I cannot quite see what you have written on the paper, but you've been raising your hand for a long
time.

Vladimir Putin: There is a man in a mask. You're next, okay?

Svetlana Shevchenko: I can speak, aren't I?

Vladimir Putin: Please, please.

Svetlana Shevchenko: Svetlana Shevchenko, Novosibirsk, Novosibirsk Region.

We are an agroindustrial region and produce high-quality products with added value for export. However, recently
we have had an acute shortage of young personnel in the countryside. It has had a real impact: there are not
enough personnel despite rural mortgages and the development of rural areas.

Mr President, what would you advise us? What measures should we take to attract new youth and retain those who
already live in the countryside?

Vladimir Putin: This is a very important question, because agriculture is a key sector of the Russian economy. I
have already said that it is developing at a good pace: three percent per year. We cannot but be pleased with what
is happening in agriculture.

I have already given this example, but I will still say this, if I remember it right. In 1986, if I remember correctly, the
Soviet Union purchased 35 million tonnes of grain. Last year, we exported 56 million tonnes. We started exporting
grain back in 2000, but it was only 1.2 or 1.3 million tonnes; and today it is 66 million tonnes. It seems impossible,
but it is happening.

Look, we are among the three largest exporters of food to the world market, and the top one wheat exporter in the
world. Last year we had a record harvest of 148 million; this year it will be 130 million, but this is also a very large
harvest, and we are stable: we have harvested over 100 million tonnes for 10 years and have a stable large supply

                                                                                                      Page 48 of 62
                             

for export operations. As I have already said, we have completely covered our need in meat - 100 percent - and we
export it.

There are problems with dairy, fruit and vegetable products, but there is also a development programme.
Everything is growing gradually.

Social issue in the country is one of the most important problems. There is a programme for the socioeconomic
development of the countryside, and overall its has funding. Of course, it may be not enough, but the main thing is
to increase the level of well-being and income of people living in the countryside. All other issues will be resolved
based on this. I am sure that we will make progress in this area.

Personnel is also a key element. We have traditionally focused on personnel since the Soviet Union era, and now
work in the rural areas is becoming more interesting. It is a whole industry now. It requires high-class specialists in
various areas: biology and chemistry, in addition to traditional agronomists, and genetics as well.

For example, genetics is an important area, and it is currently developing at the highest pace precisely because of
and in the interests of agriculture.

I think all this is very interesting, and we should talk about this not only at events like this once a year, but
constantly, as well as create conditions for young people who would be interested in coming and working in this
sector of the economy.

The government will do everything possible to attract applicants this industry needs; and manufacturers must do
what they do in other industries: create conditions to send people for training intentionally, pick personnel they need
during the training, and ensure their work at enterprises and industrial practice. We will certainly provide for all of
this.

Dmitry Peskov: Mr President, you promised to take a question from the journalist wearing a mask.

Vladimir Putin:Yes, please.

Andrei Knyazev: I have already taken off the mask. I wear it because I use the metro as probably most of those
present here do.

I am Andrei Knyazev, a volunteer with Argumenty Nedeli - Uzbekistan, and head of The World of the Young, a
studio of young and adult journalists in Moscow.

Here is my question. This year marks 45 years of my journalistic career which I started in Uzbekistan and have
been persuing here for the past 30 years. I see that paper journalism is dying out. Maybe bloggers like Vlad
Bumaga will help independent newspapers which depend only on their readers, not on the goverment or business
people.

What do you think can be done to stop at least weekly press from dying? Becasue the bloggers we have now are
not always intelligent, not always sincere and not always good. This is my short question.

I asked my second question to many officials, inlcuding Ms Zakhartova, the Foreign Minsitry spokeswoman. She
told me to address the President's Direct Line. That's why I am here.

A great number of our scientists and many clairvoyants say that within the coming 10 to 12 years European
countries, Japan, the United States and the American continent will be submerged or destroyed. However, the
peopole will survive and they will ask to come to us, Mr President. Meanwhile, they are against us. Should they be
informed in advance?

This is hypothecal, of course. Yet, there are such forecasts. I read a lot, and I basically read newspapers, not those
lying Telegram channels and others of the kind.

                                                                                                       Page 49 of 62
                             

So I have two questions to you. Sorry for that.

Vladimir Putin: I am not sure if I should say it. Ok, I will. You know a popular joke, a banter about a family at table
with a little boy doing a crossword puzzle, who says: "Tell me a four-letter word." His mom hits him on the forehead
with a spoon - bang! He cries: Why? It's 'home.' Then the father bangs his wife saying: "You should think about your
home! Think about your home."

You have said that some continents would be underwater and we should think about what is to be done with those
people. We should think about our home!

Andrei Knyazev: Mr President, but they will run to us. What are we going to do with them?

Vladimir Putin: I was listening to you very attentively. You are a person full of energy! Please, let me finish.

I am saying this because the forecasts you have referred to are ethemeral. They are made by serious researchers
who say that permafrost is going to start melting. This carries huge problems for the environment because new
emissions into the atmosphere will exceed those from all the vehicles in the world. So if permafrost starts melting,
the coastal regions of the Russian Federation are also in danger.

We have entire villages and towns with houses built on stillts in the permafrost. They already hear some crepitation
underneath there. That's what we should be thinking about, our coastal cities, including even St Petersburg, you
see? We did build a flood dam there, which they dreamed of building since the times of Peter the Great. But we
should think about what will happen to the coastal cities. We should think about our homeland first.

Andrei Knyazev: And about the paper journalism.

Vladimir Putin: I'll be right with you on that. If people begin relocating to us, we have unemployment at 2.3 percent,
it's practically non-existent. We are talking about labour migration and issues related to it.

You are right, think about that. If there is a massive influx of people, we must think about how to cope with it and
where and how to accommodate those people. We are the biggest country in the world but do you know how many
people live east of the Ural Mountains? About 12 million people. We do have space to resettle people.

In principle, we have to think about social and other infrastructure and rules in advance. It is not really an empty
question. You are so egregious when you say all this, but there is actually an issue. I repeat once again: First of all,
we need to think about the problems we have in our country.

As for paper journalism and help from Vlad Bumaga, I think that such fellows, of course, will gladly support you,
especially since we are talking about paper journalism in this case.

I think that paper journalism will have its place in this huge changing world, just like the paper book. You can flip
through a gadget, and everything is in good font there and in different languages. I myself, frankly speaking,
sometimes use it. But picking up a book is a different story. Not only because there are pictures - although that is
also interesting to look at - and a book illustration is sometimes a work of art, too.

Picking up an issue of Izvestia or Komsomolskaya Pravda, leafing through it, digging in it - there's a thrill in that,
isn't there? I hope that those who are engaged in paper journalism will also take this into account and keep this
remaining public interest alive.

The most important thing, of course, is the content, because whatever the media, the most important thing, as Vlad
Bumaga said, is what's inside, the content. That's the most important thing. If paper-based media have a worthy
and interesting content compared to some internet rubbish, they will be here to stay, they will not die.

Alexandra Suvorova: Mr President, let us think about home, above all, a healthy one. This topic is among those the
Russians are most concerned about. If we look at statistics, healthcare and related issues come second - people
ask about the shortage of doctors in outpatient clinics, and pretty often about a lack of some medicines.

                                                                                                        Page 50 of 62
                             

I suggest we listen to a telephone call from Irina Sychyova from Nizhny Novgorod.

Mr Sychyova, good afternoon. Please, ask your question.

Irina Sycheva: Good afternoon, Mr President.

My name is Irina Sycheva. I am from Nizhny Novgorod.

I would like to draw your attention to our free medical care. First, I would like to sincerely thank you for the
renovated outpatient clinics. Thank God, they are starting to make them look decent.

However, these outpatient clinics are in a dire shortage of medical specialists and primary care physicians as the
doctors are leaving to work in commercial clinics. What should we, retired and low-income people, do in this
situation?

For over a month, I have been unable to obtain an appointment with a cardiologist for my father who suffered a
heart attack recently. This doctor receives patients only once a week. There are no online appointments because
the doctor is not working full-time. To get an appointment, people have to queue outside the clinic from 5 or 6 am,
and their chances are pretty slim. The people are standing on the street until 7 am, when the outpatient clinic
opens. Many elderly people are unable to cope with this situation. We hope that you will resolve this issue.

Thank you very much in advance.

Vladimir Putin: Ms Sycheva, healthcare issues - and I perceive them in the context of the entire range of issues -
come second, I think. Yes, second. This is always very important - in all countries, by the way, including those with
the so-called developed market economy. It appears that the situation there is now even more acute than in Russia.
But why should we care about them? I agree that we should think about our home country.

So, thank you for mentioning the renovated outpatient clinic. This means that things are moving, nevertheless.

We have a whole programme, I'll talk about it in a second. Because our main problem is human resources. This
problem exists in primary care sector. We have hospitals, with doctors and physicians working there, as you know -
we have no personnel shortages there, while in primary care this problem does exist. This results in an obvious
conclusion: the problem is mostly linked with the way a healthcare system is organised in the Russian Federation's
regions.

Speaking about the hospital bed rotation, we can see that beds in hospitals are not fully used all year round. At the
same time, there is a problem in primary care, including outpatient clinics and district hospitals where medical
specialists work every day. Local healthcare authorities are supposed to distribute the load correctly. This is the first
thing.

The second aspect is linked with personnel training. We are trying, and the Healthcare Ministry is trying to enrol as
many applicants at universities as possible. The process is ongoing. We have started paying an additional 50,000
and 29,000 rubles to doctors and nurses at small communities, and this is also quite important. For the first time in
several years, we can see an influx of 17,500 specialists, but their number is still not enough.

Going back to the organisation of healthcare and the need to continue strengthening the primary care sector, we
should certainly be doing all this much quicker than we did before. I cannot help but agree with this. Speaking of
your particular case, my colleagues will give me your data. You do have the information, right?

Alexandra Suvorova: Yes.

Vladimir Putin: We'll do all we can and will certainly help your father.

Dmitry Kulko: Let us continue with the topic of healthcare. It is important.

                                                                                                       Page 51 of 62
                             

Compared to last year, the number of complaints regarding shortage of medicines has gone down this year, but we
still have them, and they mainly concern subsidised prescription drugs.

For instance, here is what a pensioner from Kerch wrote us, "I have cancer. I was prescribed free medication, but
the last time I had it for free was three months ago. I called the hotline in Simferopol and was told the drugs were
unavailable. I have to buy them with my own money now. Please help resolve this issue."

This is not limited to expensive medications - the situation with absence of normal saline was especially striking.
People with diabetes also report difficulties with obtaining insulin. Here are a few examples.

Rashida Gainutdinova had the following to write to us: "In Neftekamsk, I have not been able to obtain insulin for four
months now. I used to get it from a hospital, but it is no longer available there. I cannot buy it at the pharmacy
either."

Vitaly Mayorov from Atkarsk, the Saratov Region, "I have had type 1 diabetes for 50 years now. I have never
experienced such poor insulin and test strip availability."

Mr President, where does the domestic pharmaceutical industry stand at this point, and what is your take on
patients' access to essential medications for cancer and other acute conditions?

Vladimir Putin: This is a critically important issue, just like ensuring we have enough medical specialists and
doctors.

The pharmaceutical industry is high on our list of priorities. You might be aware that as far back as 2008, when I
served as the Prime Minister, we started working on developing our own pharmaceutical industry.

We began discussing this in 2008 and started creating programmes to this end. These programmes were finalised
in 2009. They went by different names, but they came down to one and the same thing which was developing our
own pharmaceutical industry. I cannot give you the exact budget we set aside back then, but this sector has largely
grown with the help and support of the state, mostly through federal funding.

More recently, our pharmaceutical companies have begun investing their own resources into growing this business,
and the investment amounts to impressive tens of billions of rubles, around 40 billion, I believe.

We now have development programmes of our own in place and have started creating our own medications based
on our own molecules and producing our own APIs, which we did not have before. We have begun manufacturing
complex medicines, including for cancer treatment. This sector is doing quite well, particularly in St Petersburg. The
same goes for insulin.

As for test strips and similar supplies, the issues arise from operational shortcomings and delays at local levels.
Overall, funding for these medications is allocated in full. The challenge lies in organising procurement and making
timely decisions.

I will certainly discuss this with the colleagues in the Government and regional administrations. It is essential to act
promptly and understand the market's needs.

We have a programme for expanding the pharmaceutical industry, which is part of the technological leadership
initiative. This programme specifically addresses medication production. By 2030, we aim to meet 90 percent of the
demand for vital medicines with domestic medications, and 40 percent of the demand for medical products.

Overall, this work is moving, and the pace is good. However, this is a major undertaking, and things do not always
go without a fault. Please provide the details, and we will see if there are any disruptions. I am sure there are.

Regarding insulin, we have always had sufficient supplies of it. Normal saline is not a problem. I am following these
developments. It is not about the saline solution itself, but the package. What happened is that two agencies - the

                                                                                                      Page 52 of 62
                             

Ministry of Industry and Trade and the Healthcare Ministry - failed to agree on the package price in time. The
proposed price made production a loss-making operation, forcing manufacturers to import packages.

All due decisions have been made by now, and I hope these setbacks are a thing of the past. We will certainly look
into this specific case.

Thank you.

Dmitry Kulko: Mr Peskov, please take the baton.

Dmitry Peskov: Thank you. Let's go into the audience.

Remark from the audience.

Dmitry Peskov: You know, we won't go far like that.

Vladimir Putin: Go ahead, please. But let's not act that way. Chaos will reign this hall, and we won't be able to
cope with it. Please.

Ksenia Aksyonova: Thank you. I apologise.

Ksenia Aksyonova, Spas TV channel.

I will ask questions that have in common a phrase of a person whom I know you respect very much and whom the
entire Russian church loves. This is the spiritual father of our Patriarch, Elder Iliy (Nozdrin).

At the beginning of the special military operation, he listed three conditions for victory: ban abortions, ban foul
language, and bury Lenin's body.

I have three questions on these three points.

First, abortions. Our Patriarch has been talking about removing abortions from the compulsory medical insurance
system each and every year, because it is not a medical procedure, and it does not help but maims. The leaders of
traditional religions in Russia support the Patriarch in this. Will this be done?

Second, foul language. Recently, you have given an exhaustive opinion on the subject saying that it is anti-prayer
and an invocation of dark forces. In order not to repeat myself, I will ask specifically about dark forces, because
esoterics, occult science, fortune telling, accessible pornography are currently booming in Russia, and people are
now spending more money on psychics than on doctors. Porn sites are now the most visited in our country. Will
there be any measures taken to restrict these clearly dangerous types of activity?

Third, burying Lenin's body. I am not talking about an assessment of his actions right now. You have done that
many times. I'm referring specifically to fulfilling his will and that of his family, and that keeping an embalmed body
in the Mausoleum is a pagan and ungodly custom. Please tell me what is preventing us from burying Lenin's body?

Thank you.

Vladimir Putin: These questions are clearly not for an extended news conference or a direct line. All of them are
very sensitive.

As for abortions, of course, here we should be thinking about how not to harm people's religious beliefs and at the
same time deal with our demographic challenges. However, we should also think about the level of well-being of
Russian families with children, their future and women's right to make decisions. This is a delicate issue that cannot
be resolved at a news conference, just like porn sites and so on.

                                                                                                          Page 53 of 62
                              

See, some people don't like that YouTube is slowing down. You say, "in our country," but I think porn sites are
visited all over the world. First come porn sites, and then one can think about ordering a cutlet, you see. All over the
world. This is not just our problem; it is a problem in many other countries.

What answer can there be? In fact, any bans are possible, but it is always about offering a more interesting
alternative to porn sites, so that a person would go to a porn site and say: I have already seen this, I want to watch
something different. Something captivating. (Laughter in the audience.)

The same goes for the burial of Lenin's body. Someday, society will probably come to this. But today, especially
today, we must not take a single step that would split the society in Russia. That's how I see it.

Overall, Iliy is right, of course. I like him and always listen to what he says. I know, he told me about it.

Dmitry Peskov: Can we take a question from that sector?

Mr President, Kolesnikov is there. I have completely forgotten about him. If I may.

Vladimir Putin: Please go ahead, Andrei.

Andrei Kolesnikov: Good afternoon.

Andrei Kolesnikov, Kommersant newspaper.

Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon.

Andrei Kolesnikov: Mr President, the war has been on for nearly three years now, and we all have changed much.
The war changed everyone. How have you changed? Have you found out anything new about yourself?

I have one more question, if Mr Peskov does not object. No one has asked this question yet, and perhaps never
will, but I am curious. Some time ago, as is widely known, US President Joe Biden pardoned his son Hunter, who
had been convicted of making a false statement when buying a firearm. This caused quite a stir around the world,
and everyone had something to say about that, yet you remained silent. Perhaps, you have nothing to say about
that. What do you think about that anyway?

Thank you.

Vladimir Putin: They say silence is golden. It is better to keep things to yourself sometimes.

Thank you for the question, though.

Regarding Biden pardoning his son, even though he promised not to do so, it is a delicate matter. Our history has
other examples to offer. Everyone saw the famous painting, Ivan the Terrible and His Son Ivan. That story may be a
legend or not, just like what happened to the son of Peter the Great, Alexei. Or take Stalin - and this is no legend,
when he refused to exchange his son Yakov, who was in captivity, for Field Marshal Paulus, saying, "I will not
exchange a marshal for a soldier."

You see, it is a personal decision, but during the war even surrendering was considered an act of treason. Why?
You can cite all kinds of reasons, but at that time the country was facing possible annihilation of not only its
statehood, but also its people. It was a battle for survival of the ethnicity, our nation. The measures taken to ensure
victory were harsh, if not cruel.

Considering this public mindset, which Stalin likely abided by, he was unable to save his son. He said what he said
and did what he did.

As we know, Stalin's son was executed in a camp, while Paulus was "used" during the Nuremberg Trials. When
Paulus entered the courtroom, everyone gasped as no one expected to see him there.

                                                                                                       Page 54 of 62
                             

As for Biden, he is a politician, you know, and it is always important to understand what is dominating you - a
politician or a human. It turns out Biden is more human than politician. I would not judge him for that.

Alexandra Suvorova: The first part of Andrei Kolesnikov's question was about the three years of the special military
operation and the ongoing hostilities.

Vladimir Putin: What has changed?

Andrei Kolesnikov: How have you changed over the past three years?

Vladimir Putin: You know we all change every day, and every hour. I think everyone in the audience and the
people who are listening or watching us also change. That is the fact of life: everything changes, and nothing stands
still. These past three years, or rather over two years, have been a serious test for all of us, including our country
and me personally.

Let me give it to you straight: we are sitting here, joking occasionally, with laughter being heard in the audience, but
I now make fewer jokes and almost stopped laughing.

There is another circumstance. I am now honing what I consider my skills - let us call them that - in identifying key
issues and concentrating my attention and energy on solving them.

Dmitry Peskov: Moving on. Let's go to the diametrically opposite sector.

I see RBC. RBC, please.

Polina Khimshiashvili: Good afternoon.

Polina Khimshiashvili, RBC.

Just to follow up on the question already posed. You have said that now you laugh and smile less. If it were
possible to go back to February 2022, would you change your decision?

Vladimir Putin: Such a hypothetical question: "If it were possible..." You know, if I could look at the situation in
2022, knowing what is happening now, what would I think? That the decision that was taken in the beginning of
2022 should have been taken earlier. This is my first point.

And second, being aware of this, we should have simply started to get ready for these measures, including for the
special military operation. Indeed, the Crimean events were simply spontaneous and we also started the events of
2022 without any special preparations. But why did we start them? It's because it was impossible for us to stand still
any longer and tolerate and wait until the situation becomes worse for us. That's what it's all about.

After all, the Kiev authorities declared that they were not going to honour the Minsk agreements. They said it in a
straightforward manner, laying their claims on some sort of weapons of mass destruction. We saw that we had
been deceived regarding the Minsk agreements, with war and massacre and destruction of people in Donbass
going on for eight years. Nothing was happening, they repudiated the Minsk agreements.

What's more, we saw that they simply set on military development of these territories while at the same time
destroying everything connected with Russia. We could no longer remain in the state we were in. They forced us to
do what we did. If we had known in advance what was going to happen, of course, we would have engaged in
serious systemic preparations. That's what I would mean.

Dmitry Peskov: Friends, we have already been working for four hours.

Vladimir Putin: Let's give the floor to the colleagues. Please pass the microphone.

Yekaterina Lazareva: Thank you, Mr President.

                                                                                                        Page 55 of 62
                             

Hello,

Yekaterina Lazareva, URA.RU agency.

Today, you mentioned European leaders as well as the new and the current American leader.

My question is: in 2025, Russia will mark the 80th anniversary of Victory in the Great Patriotic War, and I know that
you are already extending invitations to leaders from various countries. However, if we recall, this year, for the
anniversary of the Allied landing in Normandy, France did not invite us. Additionally, there will be memorial events
at Auschwitz in January 2025, and to my knowledge, we have not been invited either.

Have you extended invitations to our allies in the Anti-Hitler Coalition for Victory anniversary celebrations in 2025,
encouraging them to come to Moscow? Is it important to you that the leaders of the United States, the United
Kingdom, and perhaps France attend, or at least send representatives?

Thank you.

Vladimir Putin: First, as for being invited anywhere, we are not seeking invitations. We are happy here at home.
Our focus is on strengthening ourselves, that is the essence of our work.

Second, we will never forget the sacrifices our people made in the fight against Nazism. The most important thing is
that we remember. If other countries are trying to forget, it reflects the priorities of today's leaders, who are focused
on undermining Russia as a whole, forgetting, erasing, and shifting focus. But that is their own business.

We will be happy to welcome anyone who wishes to join us in celebrating this significant anniversary. While I
personally sign some invitations, the Foreign Ministry handles most of the arrangements. My stance is that we are
open to all who wish to be with us in Moscow on those days and mark this important anniversary.

We will be happy to welcome everyone, including the participants of the Anti-Hitler Coalition, who made a significant
contribution to the victory over Nazism, such as the United States and Great Britain with its northern convoys. There
were many heroes among them too, and we honour and respect them. Moreover, I believe there are still veterans
among them. The British sailors demonstrated true heroism, and the Americans fought during the landing in
northern France.

Indeed, their participation and losses are not comparable to those of the Soviet people in the Great Patriotic War.
We lost 27 million, while the United States lost around 500,000, and Great Britain lost even less: around 400,000, if
I am not mistaken. Although in World War I, they lost 1.5 million. So, the scale of their contribution to Victory is
different, but their involvement was still significant, especially since they were with us. They supported us through
Lend-Lease. It is true, though, that we eventually paid for it in full. When I became President, we paid off the entire
Lend-Lease debt. The Americans got that money from us, you see. We paid that in full, even though so many years
passed by.

Nonetheless, we value the contribution of our allies to the shared struggle and will be happy to welcome anyone
who wishes to join us in celebrating the joy of Victory.

Dmitry Kulko: Mr President, we still have many questions left, including personal ones.

Vladimir Putin: Let's take another question from the audience.

Yamal. What is Yamal up to?

Andrei Zhizhin: Good afternoon, Mr President.

Andrei Zhizhin, Yamal-Media.

Western countries have imposed over 20,000 sanctions...

                                                                                                        Page 56 of 62
                             

Vladimir Putin: It is 40,000, I believe.

Andrei Zhizhin: 40,000?

Vladimir Putin: Frankly, I stopped counting.

Andrei Zhizhin: They have a particular issue with our progressive development in the Arctic. It has come to the point
where they openly declare their goal to destroy and kill the liquefied natural gas production projects in the Arctic.

What are they afraid of? Do they have any success with slowing the pace of our development in the Arctic? How
are we going to respond?

Vladimir Putin: They are afraid of the competition. They are leveraging political tools to engage in unfair
competition.

Take the well-known company NOVATEK. It is not an industry leader; other countries, including the United States,
produce more LNG. However, we are getting bigger, and they are trying to hamper our growth using unfair methods
for keeping competition in check.

This may backfire if they continue to deal with competitors using non-economic methods. They will eventually lose
their competitive edge. Not tomorrow, perhaps, but someday they will if it goes on like that.

Are they in our way or not? Yes, they are. Are they creating problems for us? Yes, they are. Will they be able to
completely shut us down or to destroy us? No, they will not. They might cause us a certain amount of harm, but,
without a doubt, we will overcome these difficulties, just as we have overcome energy supply challenges in the past.
Moreover, the global demand for energy resources did not go anywhere, as the global economy still needs them.
The demand for them is on the rise and will continue to grow (this is not our data; it comes from the world economic
institutions), and this product will remain in demand on international markets. We will continue to expand our share
on the global LNG market.

By the way, the same applies to pipeline gas supplies. Ukraine refused to renew the transit contract. It was not us
who did it. Ukraine did. They refused to renew the contract, even though they used to receive about US$700-800
million a year under it.

Now, the question is what to do with it. But that is not our problem. It was Ukraine who cut off our gas supply to
European consumers. On one hand, it is eating from their hand because it can survive, not just war, but survive
only with the support of the West, including Europe, but at the same time, it is creating problems for them by cutting
off supplies of our relatively cheap gas. That contract is clearly history. Fine, we will survive. Gazprom will survive.

By the way, the other day our intelligence services told me that saboteurs, clearly Ukrainian ones, were detained in
Slovakia. They had maps of Slovakia's gas infrastructure facilities on them.

I was briefed about this just recently. I will ask our intelligence agencies to request information from their colleagues
about what exactly occurred, the connections are still in place. You see, it is not enough for them to carry out
terrorist attacks in our country; now they are targeting European countries.

Once again, they are eating from their hand, and now they are attempting acts of terror in Europe. But that is their
choice. Our choice is to pursue cooperation, and we will push forward to achieve our goals.

Kosmos, go ahead. And I can see BBC, too. You will soon get your chance to put us under fire. Go ahead. All we
do is defend ourselves.

Dmitry Maslak: Thank you.

I am a staff correspondent for the Russian Service of China state television in Moscow. We work here in Russia,
and I am a Russian citizen, although I am considered a foreign journalist.

                                                                                                        Page 57 of 62
                             

If I may, I will start with a question from China state television, from CGTN, because thanks to them I got here, and
we have been working here for the second year already.

First question. Today's programme is called "Results of the Year," and throughout the year you have been saying
that Chinese peace initiatives are among the most - I cannot remember the exact wording - but you have said that
they were more realistic than all the others proposed by the mediator countries.

We have all heard and remember that the West has exhausted its trust limit, and Russia has been deceived by
European leaders, as they themselves admitted. But if we talk about specifics, Mr Trump and his assistant Keith
Kellogg say that it is possible to end the war even before the inauguration on January 20.

We are not talking about any country joining NATO... But is it possible to cease fire in one minute? Is Russia ready
to at least take this simple step if European and American partners manage to convince Kiev?

The entire world is really tired with the Ukraine crisis, and I think people in Russia now want peace, too. This is a
simple step: nobody risks anything if everything just stops where it is. If promises are not kept or broken, it may
continue. No one will lose anything if it just stops at some point

And my second question, since this is a mixed-format event. I live in Korolev and would like to draw your attention
to the largest science town in Russia, because in fact we, the residents of Korolev, have many questions.

Currently, a National Space Centre is being built at the Khrunichev centre, and many residents of Korolev, and we
are talking about a quarter of a million, residents of the Moscow Region are perplexed: are we still the historical
space capital, where Korolev and leading designers worked, or not? For example, perhaps we need a special
economic zone on the territory of the integrated house-building factory, which they are trying to divide now; because
the city needs a boost, it needs to regain its title as the country's historical space capital, because Energia RSC
continues to work there, among other things.

This calls for building a third entrance to the city. Everyone is asking for it, because people spend up to four hours
in traffic jams. When this event is over, we will drive all the way up there to be stuck in that notorious traffic jam for
three and a half hours. We need a flyover. We have a little problem with democracy in the city. Sorry, these are
pressing issues.

Dmitry Peskov: You have combined two roles: a citizen and a journalist.

Dmitry Maslak: A direct line and a news conference.

Alexandra Suvorova: Since you are already here.

Dmitry Maslak: In fact, yes. A third entrance to Korolev. You have used this flyover personally. A third entrance is
necessary, because we are stuck, we cannot waste time in these traffic jams. I believe the entire city is applauding
now, because if you can solve this problem, it would make us very happy.

Thank you very much.

Colleagues, I apologise.

Vladimir Putin: Your employer will not be happy about the second part of your question. It is not what he has sent
you here for. But you got me right: you should care about your home. This is absolutely true.

The idea of a third entrance to Korolev was discussed. I know about it from our previous discussions on the
development of Korolev as a space capital. Another centre that is under construction in Moscow is extremely
important for the development of the space industry, but Korolev remains a prominent space centre. I will not go
into detail now, but Korolev as a science city certainly deserves to be given attention. I will discuss this matter with
my colleagues by all means, both in the Moscow Region and with those who are working in the aircraft and space
sector. They have various plans.

                                                                                                         Page 58 of 62
                              

There are grounds for the idea of a special economic zone [in Korolev]. I will not present a final decision now, but
this is something that can and should be given attention. You are right that we should think about using the
potential of Korolev. This is the first point.

Second, regarding the peace initiatives of the People's Republic of China, Brazil and South Africa. We have taken
note of them because this is a sincere attempt to find a solution. We regard it as a balanced attempt that is not
being imposed on either side, Ukraine or Russia. That is because these initiatives have been proposed by neutral
countries, which are not interfering in the conflict, unlike the Western countries, which are actually waging a war
against us by the proxy of Ukrainians. And so, their initiatives must be analysed very carefully because they are
actually a party to the conflict.

As for stopping the conflict where it is, you see, I have already spoken about the situation. We see the exhaustion of
weapons, equipment, ammunition and, most importantly, personnel in the Ukrainian armed forces. They are running
out of all this.

What do we really see on the battlefield now? Our army is advancing, while the opponent is unable to become
entrenches in the positions in has retreated to at any given day or moment. Its troops have retreated in an
organised manner, but they cannot consolidate their hold on them, because our men will continue to advance
tomorrow, and so on and so forth.

We pause for a week - we give the enemy a chance to gain a foothold and fortify their positions. It will give them the
opportunity to rest, regroup and rearm. Most importantly, it will allow them to recruit and train soldiers. With the
current shortage of personnel, they literally grab people off the streets, as I told the Defence Ministry board - they
cart people off like stray dogs. But stray dogs at least are taken to animal shelters, and subsequently put up for
adoption, and eventually get a new home. Unlike them, Ukrainian men are being sent for slaughter.

They have no time for training, and our military see this on the battlefield: their training is lacking, it is not anything
like a Soviet military school; this is a totally different story. Even those who are trained in Western countries are not
good enough compared to the Soviet training because their instructors have never fought themselves; they have
never participated in real action. How can they train anyone?

The point is that a lengthy period of relative truce will give the enemy the opportunity to improve this aspect as well -
train and retrain, and consolidate their personnel. Some battalions of the Ukrainian army have only 35 or 40 percent
of the required number of fighters. You have a battalion, but no personnel in it. Do you really want to give them the
opportunity to reman their units?

We do not need a truce. We need peace: a long-term and lasting peace with guarantees for the Russian Federation
and its citizens. It is difficult to say how these guarantees can be provided, but it is a place to start.

In fact, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban put forth a proposal for a short-term truce. This is what he told me - I
do not think Victor will be angry with me if I reveal a part of our conversation - he said, it will not hurt to call a
Christmas truce, just for a day or two, and the enemy will not be able to do anything in these two or three days. I
said, you are probably right, but you should first ask the Ukrainian side. We have earlier agreed to at least three
such proposals - on navigation in the Black Sea, on energy infrastructure, and so on.

Erdogan contacted me; ask your President. This is true, he made a proposal to me as an intermediary. I said I had
to think about it. The next day, just a day later, I called him and said we agreed. Suddenly, the head of the
Ukrainian regime announced there would be no talks and no truce. So, I called Erdogan and asked what that
meant? He said: this is what our partners do. I said: well, all right.

I have asked Orban the same question. He proposed a Christmas truce, and he also proposed a prisoner
exchange. I have not refused anything. I said we needed to think, but you should ask them. He did. The next day,
the head of the [Kiev] regime said that there would be no truce, no prisoner exchange. This is the answer to your
question.

                                                                                                        Page 59 of 62
                              

Dmitry Kulko: We have been on the air for over four hours now. Let's wrap it up.

Vladimir Putin: I promised [to take a question from] the BBC.

Go ahead.

Alexandra Suvorova: They promised to attack.

Vladimir Putin: Yes, you promised to attack. They gladly do so even without promises. This is their job; it is what
they are paid for.

Steven Rosenberg: BBC News.

Exactly 25 years ago, Boris Yeltsin resigned, transferred power to you, and said, "Take care of Russia." After 25
years, do you believe you have taken care of Russia? Because looking from the outside, what do we see? We see
substantial losses in the so-called special military operation that you declared; and we see Ukrainian soldiers in the
Kursk Region. You criticise NATO expansion, but there is more NATO now on Russia's borders: Sweden and
Finland. There are sanctions, high inflation, and demographic problems. But what do you think? Have you taken
care of your country?

Vladimir Putin: Yes. I believe I have not just taken care of it, but I believe we have stepped back from the edge of
the abyss, because with everything that was happening in and around Russia before and since was leading us
towards a complete, total loss of our sovereignty. Without sovereignty, Russia cannot exist as an independent state.

Let me draw your attention to what you said about Boris Yeltsin. Everything seemed fine; they patted him on the
back patronisingly, and turned a blind eye when he drank. He was welcome in all Western circles. But as soon as
he raised his voice in defence of Yugoslavia, as soon as he said that it violated international law and the UN
Charter, as soon as he said that striking Belgrade, the capital of a European country, without UN Security Council
approval was unacceptable in modern Europe, they immediately started having a go at him, calling him names,
saying he was a drunk, and so on. Do you not remember that?

I have done everything so that Russia can be an independent and sovereign state that is capable of making
decisions in its own interests, rather than in the interests of the countries that were dragging it towards them, patting
it on the back, only to use it for their own purposes. I could stop there. But I understand you have laid out the entire
set of arguments that seem support your stance.

You mentioned inflation. Yes, there is inflation. We will fight it. But we also have economic growth. We rank fourth in
the world in purchasing power parity. Please share that with your readers. We are first in Europe, far ahead of the
United Kingdom, which, I believe, is not even in the top five.

But we are ready to work with the UK, if the UK wants to work with us. If not, that is fine. We will cope without our
former WWII Allies.

Dmitry Kulko: Mr President, there are numerous questions from Russians, including some of a personal nature.
Time is short, so I suggest we proceed in a rapid-fire manner.

Dmitry Peskov: We have already been at it for four and a half hours.

Vladimir Putin: Let's bring it to a close.

Alexandra Suvorova: Do you have a dream? Not one related to governance, but a personal one. What is your
dream?

Vladimir Putin: Yes, I do, of course. But it is a personal dream. May I keep it to myself?

Dmitry Kulko: A question from social media. Alexandra Pukhova asks: Are you a happy person?

                                                                                                          Page 60 of 62
                              

Vladimir Putin: Do you consider this a rapid-fire question? Am I meant to respond with a simple yes or no? How
can I possibly convey that with just yes or no?

You see, the point is this: everyone knows I was born into a humble, working-class family. My ancestors crossed
the Danube back in the 19th century, and I have a document from the archives showing one of my ancestors was
awarded the Cross of St George, one of the first Crosses of St George. Then my father, along with all my relatives
on both my mother's and father's sides, fought on the fronts of the Great Patriotic War. Many died, indeed a great
many; probably every second one fell. My father was left disabled by the war. I myself served in the foreign
intelligence services, and my work has always been linked to serving the Fatherland. And of course, the fact that it
is not the first time the people, the citizens of Russia, have entrusted me with leading the Russian state is a
profound honour and an immense responsibility. So, in principle, one could say, "That's it, I am happy, thank you."
One might also say, "God forbid, what more could I want?"

But you know, the reality is that happiness cannot be complete until our lads return from the front, until their
mothers and wives reunite with them, until their children embrace them, until our young men and women form the
right number of families for us, for the country, for Russia, and have children.

I deeply desire for our scientists, artists, and cultural figures to realise their aspirations. Only then, perhaps, might it
be possible to claim that I am happy.

Alexandra Suvorova: There's a question from St. Petersburg: Why do various foreigners insult you, and yet you
remain silent?

Vladimir Putin: It comes down to one's level of culture. I have said before: "He who calls names is called that
himself." In my opinion, such behaviour is born out of impotence. Why should we showcase such impotence? We
have ample arguments to state our position clearly and succinctly.

Dmitry Kulko: An SMS from the Stavropol Region: Are there any duties you despise?

Vladimir Putin: No, there aren't. You see, if people have entrusted me with the responsibilities of the presidency,
there are certain obligations, and I aim to fulfil them with honour, at least with complete dedication.

I am aware that if I begin to harbour aversion towards any aspect of my official duties, the desired outcomes will not
be achieved. That's why, long ago, I resolved that everything I am required to do should be approached with a
sense of satisfaction.

Alexandra Suvorova: A question from the Nizhny Novgorod Region. Whose portrait is hanging in your office?

Vladimir Putin: I do not have a portrait in my office. I have an icon in one of my offices, and a bust of Lomonosov in
the other.

Dmitry Kulko: Another text message from Moscow. Would you grant political asylum to Zelensky? He will sure need
it soon.

Vladimir Putin: I do not know. I do not think he will need it. In the most likely scenario - I cannot say what he will
do, probably the same as other individuals from the top political leadership of Ukraine who went abroad - he will
leave. I think those people whose interests he serves today will take care of him.

If by any chance he suddenly popped out of nowhere, like a jack-in-the-box, appearing when we would least expect
it, and said he needed political asylum - Russia never refuses anyone.

Alexandra Suvorova: A question from Tatyana Kostyuchenko. What is Russia for you?

Vladimir Putin: This is a complex issue.

                                                                                                      Page 61 of 62
                             

You see the map opposite us. Russia, like any other country, is first of all a vast territory. But it is not just the
territory - it is history, culture, our customs and traditions. This all is Russia. And in any case, the most important
component is the people.

You know what I sometimes find myself doing lately? When I watch something - I rarely watch television, I do not
have time, I almost never go online - I always note our achievements, the successes of our people.

I recently watched the World Swimming Championships. The swimmers - strong torsos, healthy, confident, world
champions, beautiful women. I look at the boys and girls who achieve success at international [student] Olympiads.
I look at our young scientists with whom I recently met. Honestly, I look at them and I feel happy and proud, as I
would have felt at the success of my family members. Without any exaggeration, I look at them, and I am happy
and proud as if they were my family. What I am saying is I view Russia as a family.

Alexandra Suvorova: Mr President, millions of viewers have been watching us for more than four and a half hours.
We have answered numerous questions, and it is clear that there will be many more.

In conclusion, what else would you like to say to the nation?

Vladimir Putin: I just said that I view Russia as my family.

We are holding this conference ahead of the best time of the year, a season of joy - the New Year and Christmas. I
speak to many representatives of different religions, and they all say that they celebrate Christmas, just as our
neighbours celebrate Eid al-Adha, Passover, and so on.

When I meet with clergy, I often ask them: what do your people share with you at the everyday level, what do they
most often talk about, what do they regret? I do not expect them to break the Seal of Confession, of course, but do
you want to know what they answer? What is the most common regret? Giving too little attention to their children.

The New Year's is a family holiday, and Christmas even more so, so I would like to wish you to spend more time
with your loved ones. And I want to wish you all every success, happiness and prosperity.

Alexandra Suvorova: Thank you very much.

Dmitry Kulko: Thank you.

Vladimir Putin: Thank you. December 19, 2024, Moscow
